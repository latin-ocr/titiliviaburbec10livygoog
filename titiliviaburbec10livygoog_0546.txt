CHAPTER lv,

'I'he traveller from Cortona has on his left and in front of him a
ridge of hius heading down towards the lake of Trasimeue, called by
Livy “ vacantes Cortonenses, ’' and now named the Gualandra. These
hills he approaches at Ossaja, where the road begins to rise a little,
but does not pass into the roots of the mountains until the sixty-ser-
enth milestone from Florence. The uacent thence is not steep but
perpetual, and continues for twenty minute& The lake is soon seen
below on the right, with Borghetto, a round tower, close to the ποιοῖς
and the undulating hius, covered with wood, among which the road
winde, sink by degrees into the marshes near the tower. Lower than
the road, down to the right, amid these woody hilloclm, Hannibal
placed his horse3 above the road to the left is a ruin called the tower
of Hannibal. The traveller soon finds himself in a vale enclosed to
the left and in front by the Gualandm hius, bending round in a seg-
ment larger than a semicircle, and running down at each end to the
lake, which forms the chord of the arc. A small stream called the
Sanguinettp flows from the Gualandra into the lake, and an open spot
between it and the hius is still pointed out as the principal scene of
slaughter.—(Hobhouse.)

rant. Hannibal and hia army—Nata. ‘⁶ Destined by nature for,”
ete—Subit. ‘⁴ Comes close under the hins.”—Ub·· . . . consata-ct.
“ To encamp in person, with,'' etc. A sentence of dessign, and there-
fore with the verb in the subjunctive. Livy’s account of the scene
differs widely from that given by PolybiuS, who places the field of
battle not between the lake and the munumina, but in a narrow pass
with mountains on both sides and the lake in the rear.

15-28. Inexplorato. “ without reconnoitring.” See Madvig, ᾗ 429,
obs. l, for this use of the ablativa of the participle. ——Ex adverso.
‘⁴ In front of him. ”-Ab terqo ac super caput insidiae. “'l'he am-
buecades in his rear and overhead escaped his notice. ”— Cha-swa
habuit. “ When he had the army shut in,’' etc. See Madvig, ἓ 427.
