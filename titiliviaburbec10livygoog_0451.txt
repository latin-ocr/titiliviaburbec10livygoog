remisisset.—- Velitris. A colony had already been planted there. Con-
sult chap. xxxi.—-Et Norboe in montes. “To the mountains of Nor-
ba.'’ We would expect here Norbam, but from the language of the
text it would appear that this colony was settled on high grounds
which commanded the site of an earlier city. Hence, t00, the name
Norba, equis-alent to nova urbs. Norba was situated on the border of
the Volscian mountainS, overlooking the Pontine marshes, The site·
of the ancient city is entirely uninhabit-ed. The modern village of
Norma lies about half a mile to the south, on a detached hist—Qua»

gilluS, and must therefore have been but a child in the time of Tar-
quin.—Rapiant flumenta esc ayriS. Compare note on chap. xxxii„
line l5.—Utantur annona, etc. “Let them enjoy the market which

so is not so easy to decide.
