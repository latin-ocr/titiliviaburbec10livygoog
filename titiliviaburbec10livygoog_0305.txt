were elected by the comitia centuriata, to be protectore of the plebei-
anS, and their persons were declared sacred and inviolable.

At first this power was used to prevent oppression by creditore, but
C. Maenius extended his protection to plebeians who refused to serve
in the army.

A law is passed to divide a certain portion of the public domain.
The execution of this law is demanded by the plebeiam, and resisted
by the patricians.

Genucius, a Τνίὸιιηω Plebis, impeaches the consuls, and is mur-
dex-ed.

Publilius, in his first axibuneship, proposes that the Tribuni Plebis
be chosen by the comitia tributa, where the voters were plebeiam, aud
the voting by polls3 in his second Tribuneship he demands further
that AEdiles be chosen in the comitia tributa, and that this assembly
be competent to consider questions concerning the whole nation.

On the passing of these laws the number of Tribunes is raised to
five.

It is generally assumed that the two Praetors or Consuls were
from the first both patricians. Dionysiu8‚ however, gives as the
names of the two first Tribunes of the Plebs, L. Junius Brutus and
C. Siciniu8‚ both of whom were Consule, and the proposer of the first
agrarian law was Sp. Cassius the Consul. In all historic time, the
Junian, Sicinian, and Cassian gentes were plebeian. It is, therefore,
not improbable that the true state of affairs was as follows: On the
expulsion of the Tarquins the Plebs had power enough to effect the
electiori of one Consul 3 after the conquest of Rome by the Etruscans,
by which Rome lost all her land on the right bank of the Tiher, aud
her tribes were reduced by a third, the plebeiam, who are always re-
garded as a rural population‚ fell into great distress and fled to the
city, where their needs drove them to become debtors to the patri-
ciana—hence encroachments on their rights by the latter3 after the
death of the plebeian champion, Sp. Cassius, the Consule were elected
by the patriciana and their clientS, and therefore none but patriciana
became Consule: this usurpatiou was for some time acquiesced in by
the plebeians after they had secured the election of their Tribunes in
the comitia tributa under the Publilian lawa.
