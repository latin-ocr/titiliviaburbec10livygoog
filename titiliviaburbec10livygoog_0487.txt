shuddered. Like Wallenstein, Hannibal lavishes money on his
soldiers, and exacts absolute devotion and immediate obedience.
He treats Italy as Tilly treated Magdeburg—throwing into wells the
senators of Acerra, burning alive the wives of those who abandon
him, putting to the sword the Italians who would not go with him.
Brought up in a barrack‚ he is an adventurer, a soldier of fortune3 he
flings aside, after Zama, the tribune who talks against·peace‚ and
laugha at the senators who complain of the tribute.'’ “Onr ten-
dency‚” says Amold, “is to admire individual greatness far more than
nationa13 and, as no single Roman will bear compar-ison with Hanni-
bal, we are apt to murmur at the event of the contest. Never was
the wisdom of God's providence more manifest than in the issue of
the struggle between Rome and Cartbag031 Hannibal's conquest would
have stopped the progress of mankind. ”

An interesting comparison' mighthe drawn between the first and
second Semitic invasions of the West. Every place which had once
been Phoeniciau or Carthaginian fell, almost without a struggle, be-
neath the Mohammedan power. The Mediterranean coast of Africa,
the western side of Sicily, Malta, and Spainv up to the ‘Em-o, seem
rather to have been annexed to the Semitic empire of Damascus than
conquered by its arms, The townsmen of St. Augustine vcalled them-
selves Canan55 Strabo found Phoenicians and Phoenician customs at
Tartessus. Did this old Phoenician influence prepare the way for the
kindred Arabian? Like the Barcine family, the Arab commanders in
Spain founded a kingdom with little encouragement from the sover-
eign power whose servants they were. When Abdulrahman crossed
the Ebro and the PyreneeS, he defeated the Christians in two great
battles‚ in the latter of which, the Franks confessed, God alone could
count the number of the slain. The policy of Fabius was again called
forth by Charles Martel, ‘⁶ If you follow my advice, you will not in·
terrupt their march nor precipitate your attack. 'l'hey are like a
torrent, which it is dangerous to stem in its career;” and, very curi-
ously, Gibbon suggests in the case of (marles, what Varro asserts in
the ca‘se of FabiuS‚ that this dilator-y policy was adopted for the pur-
pose of weakening political enemieS.

The CarthaginianS‚ or Poeni, called themselves Canarii. Fable rep-
resents some settlements as having been made near 'the present Cape
Bon by Oanaanites fleeing from before the Israelites3 more trust—
worthy accounts assign the foundation of Hippo and Cambe in that
neighborhood to expeditione from Sidon, “ the first-born of Canaan.”
But it was under the predominance of Tyre that the great development
of Phoenician colonization took place. Of ¹these colonies Carthago
was the greatest, Tartessus ’the oldest. Utica had been founded in
Rc. 1158, and Gades (now Cadiz) a few years later, and the Phoe-
nicians afterwards planted other colonies in Spain at Calpe (Gibraltar),
Carteia (Algesiras), and Malaca (Malaga). They had factor-ies at
