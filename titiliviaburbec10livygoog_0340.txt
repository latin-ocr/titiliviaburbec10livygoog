31-38. Siqnmn contra, etc. “ He (next) mentally fixed upon some
conspicuous object, directly in front, whither his eyes carried his view

fan-thest,” i. e., at the utmost extent of view· In order to draw upon
the earth a line corresponding to the decimanus already drawn in the
heavens, the augur selecta some object, a tree‚ for instance, on the
edge of the horizon in the east, and thus full in front, from which to
draw his imaginary earth-line to the point where he is standing.—
Uei tu siqua, etc. “I pray that thou wilt make manifest unto us
sure signs within these bounds which 1 have marked. ’' With uti
supply precor, already implied in precatus. 'l'he augur prays for signs,
such as lightning, or the cry or ssight of birds (which were all certa in
their nature), to be vouchsafed unto him in the direction of the eastern
heavens, and between the two·lines in the heavens and on the earth.
-Pemyia ‘⁴ He stated in express words.'’—De templo deseendit.
“ Descended from the place of augury.” In the language of the Ro-
man ritum, templum meant a place set apart and hallowed by the
augure for taking the augur-ies. Thus Varro (L. L„ vi., 81, ed. Rip.)
remarks: ‘⁴ Templum locus, auqtm'i aut auspicii causa, quibusdam con-
ceptis verbis finitus.” The same term was also applied to the quar-ter
in the heavens within which the observatione were to be made, as it
was marked out and separated from the rest by the staff of the augur.

 

CHAPTER XIX.

1-4. Reyno ita potitus. Livy, in the previous chapter, merely
speaks of the decree of the Senate in Numa's favor, but says nothing
of his having been chosen by the people in the comitia curiata, nor of
the lex de imperio, which Numa caused to be passed, in his own case,
at a subsequent meeting of the same comitia. Compare the language
of Cicero (De Repub„ ii., 13): “ Qua· (Numa), ut huc venit, quamquam
populus curiatis eum comitiis regem esse jusserat, tamen ipse de sno im-
perio curiatam leyem tulit.’‘—-—Eam. The pronoun is emphatic here,
and equivalent to eandem—Quippe efferari, etc. ‘⁴ Since (he was
aware) that their minds were rendered ferocious by warfare.” Ob-
serve the elliptical employment of quippe, to indicate what was passing
in the mind of N uma.

6. Janum ad infimum Aryiletum fecit. ‘⁶ He constructed the (pas-
sage called) Jnnns, at the lowest part of the Argiletum.” This pas—
sage (commonly, but erroneously, called a temple) had two entrances‚
and was usually called Janus Geminus, Janus Bisions, οι· I’ortoe belli ,-
and stood ad infimum Ανρίῖεέαηι, that is, close by the Forum, ou its
north-eastern side between the Quirinal and Capitoline. In a niche
m this passage stood a statue of J anus„ It is probable that the
Janus Geminus originally was not an ordinary gate of the city, but,
