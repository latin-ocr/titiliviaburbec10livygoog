nx. 11., GHAP. xtvm. 465

14-19. Nimia qu‘a· luxuriare, etc. ‘⁴ That the once energetic spir-
it of Caeso was running to waste, and beginning to grow enfeebled
through a surfeit of glory.''—Deinde. “ For some time thereafter.'’
It would be palpably erroneous to make deinde here refer to all the
time that came after. He merely means, immediately or for some
time after 11118. The demands for an agrarian law were ever and
anon renewed by the tribunes, though without success—Eo nuth
pagum, etc. Observe that eo is here equivalent to sdeo. Compare
bk. i., chap. xi., line 29.

21-27. Temeritate. As he carried eu the war alone, and without
the co-operation of any of the allies, his defeat is easy to be conceived.
-Res proxime, etc. ‘· The affair had come very nearly to the form
of a mere predatory excursion.’' By res is meant the campaign.
The MSS. have in formam, but the absence of the preposition makes
neater Latinity‚ ‘though the other form of expression is not opposed
to the usage of the language.—Le9ionibus Romanis cedebant. “ They
retired from before the Roman legions.'’ On 11118 employment of the
dative, consult Madvig, ξ 244, a. —— Elude'ntes. “ Evading.'' The
verb eludere is properly said of gladiatore avoiding a blow by shifting
the body, etc. Ludus is the gladiatorial school or combas-Neque
omitti, etc. ‘⁶ Could neither be wholly disregarded nor yet brought
to a conclusion.’'

28-34. Proesentia. “At the very time.'’—Non diutius, qaam recens,
etc. “ No longer 111811 (while) the fresh smart of their late disaster
would be passing off.’'—Mox moturos se. “Would soon put them-
selves in motion.” Livy here varies the construction. We would
have expected the clause to run as follows: Aut exspectabantur, ut
a Sabinis, etc. He makes the change, however, in order to lay the
emphasis on Sabinos and Etruriam. —Assiduus maqis qaam yravis.
‘⁸ l’ersevering rather than seriously formidable.’'—-Animos aqitabat.
‘⁴ Kept their minds in constant uneasinesS.'’ Observe the force of
the imperfect. -Averti alio. “ To 111111 their attention elsewhere.”
Referring to the Romans. The passive in· a reflexive sense, and

{quivalent to avertere se, like the middle voice in Greek. (Zumpt,
146.)

35-40. Assiduo magis, etc. ‘⁴ A permanent rather than a large
military post.’' Proesidium is often used in the same sense with ref-
erence to colonies sent out to such a posu—Vos curate. “ Do you
attend to. ''—Hostes. “As foes.”—Auctores sumus. “We pledge
ourselves.''—Nobis in animo est. ‘⁴ It is in our contemplation.''—
Res publica et milite, etc. “ Let the state be exempt from (the charge
of providing) both soldier-y and money in that war.’' Illic is here
equivalent to in illo bello.
