forgers of this tale forget that Romulus is nowhere represented in the
ancient legend as a tyrant, but as a mild and merciful monarch, whose
rule became still more gentle after the death of Tatius, whom it
branded as a tyrant.-Pavor praesens, “The awe felt at the time.”
This, of course, would lead to the superstitious belief that he had been
carried up to heaven. Pavor here has nothing whatever to do with
any fear of the fathers, as some erroneously suppose.

18-20. Consilio. “By the contrivance.”—Proculus ‚fulina Livy
speaks of this individual here as having been a man of authority and
influence. Plutarch also (Vir. Rom. 28) describes him as a man of'
the highest rank, and of exemplary character. Cicero, on the other
hand, calls him homo aqrestis (De Repub„ ii.‚ 10), and speaks sneer-
ingly of him, comparing the legend of his interview with the deified
Romulus with the Attic fable of Orithyia carried off by Boreas (De
Ley„ ‚i.,¹ l).'—Gravis‚ ut traditur, etc. “ A weighty authority, as is
said, for any fact, however important.”

24-31. Ut contra intueri, etc. “That it might be allowed me
(without harm) to look upon him face to face. '’ The ancients had a
belief that it was not safe for a mortal to look a deity full in the face,
and therefore it was usual to cast the eyes to the ground in supplica-
tione—Mirum quantum, etc. ‘⁶ It is wonderful how much credit was
given to that man on his announcing these thing8.’' The earliest
manuscripts have fides, which many editors adopt, making it an ar-
chaistic form for the genitive of the fifth declension. (Compare
Schneider, L. G„ vol. iii„ p. 355.) We have preferred, however, to
follow Drakenborch, who gives fidei from some manuscripts, the ordi-
nary form of the ease. Duker remarks that quantum fides may be
justified by taking quantum for in quantum, and regnrding fides as a
nominative, but this would be harsh and unusual.—Facta fide immor-
talitatis. “ On his immortality being vouched for. ”

 

CHAPTER XVII.

1-6. Requi. For ck reque—Necdum ad sinqulos pervenerat, etc.
The manuscripts have α sinyulis, and pervenerant sactiones. But we
have adopted, in place of the former, the excellent emendation of
Graevius, ad sinqulos, and have changed the latter in accordance with
some of the best editions. The subject of pervenerat will be the
combined idea implied in certamen requi and cupidm· and we may
translate as follows: “Nor as yet had (this feeling of rivali-y) come
upon them individually.’' It was not a struggle between individual
competitors for the throne, hut one of factions or parties in the state,
as explained immediately asten—Inter ordines. “ Between the dif-
