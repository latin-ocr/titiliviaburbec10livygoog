ΒΚ. 1., anP. xxxu. 357

chap. xx„ line 19.—Ab ana parte. “In one particular.” More lit-
erally, ‘⁶ From on one side.”—Reli9ionibus. ‘⁴ The rites of religion. ”
—Prave cultis. ‘⁴ Improperly performed. ”——Lonqe antiquissimum.
“ By far most important.’' The literal idea is, a thing that should
take priority before all othei-S. We have a similar usage in the Greek
πρεσβύτερον and πρεσβύτατον.- Omnia ea ex commentarii8‚ etc. “ He
orders the pontiff to exhibit all of them in public, transferred from the
king’s commentaries to a white tablet,’' i. e.‚ to transcribe an account
of the true mode of celebrating these riteS, from the sacred books of
Numa, on a white tablet or more, and fix them up in public. Among
the Romam, the album was either a white material or a material
whitened3 and of course the writing would be of a different color.
According to some authorities, however, it was so called because the
writing was in white lettera—Pontificem. The pontifex maximus is
meant. Some editions insert maximum here. The epithet mant-imm,
however, is not properly found applied to him-earlier than in book ii.‚
chap. ii.

20-23. Medium erat in Anco inqem‘um. “There was in Ancus a
genius of a middle kind.”—Memor. “Partaking of that.” More
literally, ‘⁴ mindful of.”—0'um in novo, etc. “ (As) in the case of
both a neW, and particularly an uncivilized people.''—Etiam‚ quod
illi contiqisset otium, etc. ‘⁴ He also (believed) that, as regarded the
tranquillity which had fallen to the lot of the other, this he himself
would not be likely easily to maintain‚ without suffering insult: that
his patience was tried, and when tried was contemned3 and that the
times were fitter for a Tullus—king than a Numa.'’ Observa that illi
refers to Numa.

27-29. Proderentur. “Should be given forth,'’ i. e.‚ promulgated.
—Jus descripsit. “ He copied the form,'’ i. e.‚ borrowed it. Jus is
the legal and established form or ceremony used in doing anything3
carmen, a few sentences after, means the language or words used in
going through it. —AEquiculis. The AEquiculi inhabited the mountain-
ous district around the upper valley of the Anio. They would appear
to have been the same people with the AEqui‚ though in the usage of
later times the former name was restricted to the inhabitants of the
more central and lofty valleys of the Apennines, while those who ap-
proached the borders of the Latin plain, and whose constant wars
with the Romans have made them so familiai-ly known to us, uni-
formly appear under the name of AEqui.-Fetiah³. Ancus merely
assigned new functions to this order, which had been established be-
fore. Compare chap. xxiv.‚ line 16.

31-40. Capite velato filo. “ His head being encircled with a fillet
(the fillct is os wool).’'—Audiatfics. “ Let the justice-of heaven hear. ”
