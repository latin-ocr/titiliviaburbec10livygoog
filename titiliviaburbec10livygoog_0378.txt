whether we are to follow the Etrurinn or the Roman tradition
about Servius is one of those points on which no certainty can be by
any possibility obtained. So much, however, seems clear, that Ser·
vius usurped the throne. He seized the royulty upon the murder of
the former king, without being elected by the Seuate and the comi-
tia, and he introduced great constitutional changes, apparently to
strengthen his power against a power-ful faction in the state. It is
equally clear that his reign came to a violent end: he was dethroned
and murdered by the descendants of the previous king, in league with
his enemies iu the state, who sought to recover the power of which
they had been dispossessed. It may be conjectured, therefore, that
Tarquinius Priscus aud Tarquinius Superbus were both of Etrurian
origin, and represent au Etruriam sovereiguty at Rome, and that the
reign of Servius Tullius represents a successful attempt of the Latius ⁴
to recox-‘er-their independence‚ or, in any case, the sovereiguty of an
Etrurian people different from the one to which the Tarquins be-
longed. (smith,Dict. Bioq„ vol. ii.‚ p. 1186.)

of the sovereign power should not render all tieS‚ even among the
members of his own family, faithless and hostile. ”-Peropportune.

the other he would have found their sentiments in his favor, but that,
as no proof was necessary, he had tried neither.
