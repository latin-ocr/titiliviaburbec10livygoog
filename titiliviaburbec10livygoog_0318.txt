the citadel, lest they might proceed to the pslsce and lend nid to the
king—Ut coquus· essent. “How they had become known.”—Gon-
tionem. More correct than concionem. Ι Observe that contio ieby con-
traction for conventia—Aquam inyressi. “ Having entered with a
band of followe1·s.”—Ratmn effecit. “Ratified.’·

14-17. Amana re. “ The Alban state. ”—Et supererat multitudo,

etc. ‘⁴ And i'n fact there was an over-flowing number of Albans,’'etc. .

Livy follows the common account. But the truth ie, Rome was not
a colony of Alba in the strict sense of the term3 nor do we find any
evidence of those mutual relations which might be expected to subsist
between s parent city eud its offspring. In tect, no mention of Alba
occurs in Roman history from the foundation of Rome until the reign
of Tullus Hostilius.—Quifacoe·ent. The subjunctive here assigns the
reason.

19-25. Intervenit. ‘⁴ Intruded itself.’'-—Avttum maliem. “ An evil
fnom which their grandfather had been a sufferer.''—AEtatis vere-
cundia. “ Respect for age,” i. e.‚ the respect due to seniority.-Quo-
rum tutelae. “ Under whose p1·otection.'’ The genitive here is more
elegant than the ordinary in toteh—-Leyerent, For &qamt—Impe-
rio reyerct. ‘⁴ Should rule it with sovereign sway.’'—Ad inauanandum
temph caffiunt. “ They choose as places of observation for taking
the omens.” Templum, in its primary nonen, signifies a portion
which is cut off3 and then it refers to au imaginary space in the
heavens, marked off by an augur with his wand‚ in order to circum-
scribe a certain boundary within which he took his observatione on
the ssight of birds, -Ραῖατίαηι, A substantive; its con-esponding ad·
jective is Pantanus. So Aventinum is here also a substantive.

1-5. Priori Remo. The dative often occurs thus with venio to in·-
dicste one who receives any thing—Daph numerus. The number
12 was held peculiarly sacred among the Etruriam. It here points
to the duration of Rome during 12 saecula—Sua multitudo. “ His
own numerous party.”—Tempore illi praeoepto, etc. “The partisans
of the former claimed the sovereignty (for Remus) on the ground of
priority of time; but those of the latter on the ground of the (greater)
number of birds.’'

6-14. C'um altercatione, etc. “ Having met in alteration, from the
contest of tungry feelings they are turned to bloodshed.’'— Vuzqatior.
