heads.''— Via. ‘⁴ By the read belovv.” Ablative of ronta—Imminea-
tes . . . transire. For a similar arrangement of participle and infini-
tive, see bk. xv„ chap. x.‚ primos superasse, postremos appropinquantes
viderunt.—Immobiks . . . defixit. “ Struck them niotionleSS.'' *Vi-
dere. Third person plural of perfect indicative. —·- Trepidatt'onem.
‘⁴ Confused hurry.''—Misceri. “Was thrown into confusion.”—- Ter-
νοτ-τῖε. Genitive after quidquid.—Perversis. The reading given in
the text is that of the MSS„ but it seems corrupt. Madvig conject-
ures &anaema—Juxta invia ac deria adsueti. With the punctua-
tion in‘ the text invia ac devia are accusatives after adsueti—a con-
struction found in virgil, AEn„ vi., δή, assuescite bella. Some edi-
tors prefer to take invia ac dwia with decurrunt, comparing Catullus,
lxiv„ 6, vada decurrere,· some again insert by conjecture per before
invia.-—Devn'a. “ By-road8.'’

12-23. Ab iniquitate oppuynabatnr. The iniqnitas loci is personifled,
and consequently takes the construction of the agent, i. e.‚ the abla-
tive with the proposition ‹za—Sibi quoque tendente. “Each struggling
for himself ;” quoque being ablative of quisque.—Insestum faciebant.
“ Were disturbing.’'—-Repercussae valks. “ The re-echoing valleys.”
Repercussae is properly applicable to the sounds reflected, but is here
transferred to what reflects the soundS. —nsultosque “Many of
the baggage-train.''—In immensum altitudinis. These phraseS, con-
sisting of an adjective used substantively in the neuter singular, and
followed by a partitive genitive, 'seem to have been formed on the
analogy of multum diei.- They are used almost exclusively to express
relations of quantity and of degree. —Sed ruinae maxime modo. “ In
the fashion of some fall (of a building) ;'’ “as if some building fell
down.’'— Quae' quamquam, etc. It might have been expected that
Hannibal would send assistance3 bnt, instead of doing se, he halted
and kept back his men.

set. Here the pluperfect subjunctive after periculum esse, ne marks the
result as future. Compare bk. xxii„ chap. xiV.‚ line 33, Vereor ne ser-

. paverint—Liberata. “ Had been left open.”—Montanis. The abla-

tive of the person is here used without the preposition α, to assimilate
the construction to that of loeo, the moutam· being regarded not as

agents, but as instrumenta—Primo. “ 111 the very first engagement.” Υ
