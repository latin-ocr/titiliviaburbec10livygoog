aside.'' Deposito is also used in the same way.—-Fundamentis templi
faciendis, etc. “ He pretended that he was engaged with completing
the foundations of the temple.’' Zumpt is right in prefer-ring faciendis
to jaciendis, on the ground that the deeper foundations‚ to which jaci-
endis would properly apply, had been laid some time' before by Tar-
quinius Priscus. Compare chap. xxxviii„ subfin.—-Minimus. Dionysi-
ηε, ou the contrary, says he was the eldest (iv., 55).—Transf'uyit ex
composito. This story is a mere imitation of that related by Herodotus
.(iii., 54, seqq.) concerning Zopyrus, with some particulars added from
the account given by the same historian (v., 92) of Thrasybulus, tyrant
of MiletuS, and Periander of Corinth—Et liberorum quoque euna, etc.
‘⁴ And that he was becoming wearied even of the guthering about him

not be led asti-ay, (he assured them) that the war still remains (im—
pending)‚” etc.—Supplicibus locus non sit. “ There be no refuge for
suppliantS,” i. e., for him a suppliant.—-AEqu03. TheAEqui were one
of the most ancient and warlike nations of Italy. They inhabited the
mountainous district around the upper valley of the Anio, and extend-
ing from thence to the lake Fucinus, between the Latius and the
Marsi, and adjoining the Hernici on the east and the Sabines on the
west. Their constant association with the Volsci would lead us to
refer them to a common stock with that natica—Hernicos. The
Hernici inhabited the upper valley of the Trem5‚ or Sacco. and bor-
dered pn the AEqui towards the north, and on the Volsci to the south
and east. Their name is said to have been derived from an old Sabine

etc.-—Veta·nt mirari. “ They bid him not be surpiised.’'—In se ipsum
posuerim saeviturum, etc. “That if other objecta fail, he win finally

und emphatic than alii would have been.—Futurumque credere. “And
they were confident it would come to pass. '’
