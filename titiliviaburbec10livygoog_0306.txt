- 1. Facturum operoe pretium sim. ‘⁴ Whether Ι be likely to ob-
tain the recompense of my labor,” i. e., whether I'be about to do a
thing worth my while. The recompenso which the writer has in
view i! the applause of his contemporaries and of posterity. Livy, as
Quintilian (ix.‚ 4, 74) remarks, begins his history with the commence-
ment of a hexameter (chtt‘ilrfisne ὄΡέΙνῶ γνέτῐΙεῖηι sim l-—). This,
of course, fixes the present reading, as Quintilian wrote only a centn-
ry, or thereabouts, after Livy. The Roman critic, however, alludes at
the same time to an emendation which had been made in the text,
nnmely‚ Facturasne sim operoe pretium, as it appears, according to
Drakenborch, in almost all the MSS. [Tacitus also commences his
Annals with a hexameter: Urbem Ι Romam Ι ρῐίηοίΡίΙο telges ha-
bulerel 3 and Sallust begins the narrative of the J ugurthine war with
Bellum Ι scriptulrns sum Ι quod populius Rolmanus13 and in various
other passages of Livy hexameters, or clauses of hexameterS, are “
found. The historiens, borrowing largely from the vocabulary of the
poets, and imitating their freer syntax, seem not to have been averse
to a poetical cadence.]

2-4. Pet-scripserim. Observe the force of the compound here, as
referring to a full and continuous history of the Roman people.——St'
sciam. ‘⁶ If Ι knew. ” The present subjunctive is often employed
when a condition that is still possible is assumed, while it is at the
same time intimated that it will not actually occur. In such a case
we often use the imperfect in English (Madvig, L. (ἦ, § 347, b).—
Ausim. “Would 1 venture. '' The old form ausim, a remnant of
the obsolete perfect ausi, was retained by the language in its more re-
fined state only in doubtful assertions and in a poten'tial sense (Mad-
vig, ξ 115, s).—Rem. “A practice. '’ The reference is to the prac-

, affice-of writing historica-l works. This, as Livy sayS, had become in
· his time an old and hackneyedone‚ and yet new „writers were contin-
ually coming fot-ward in the hope of surpassing their predecessor&—

unto -my becoming known.
