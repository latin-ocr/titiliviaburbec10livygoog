—Tribuni plebei. So called, according to Varro (L. L„ iv„ 14), be-
cause they were first chosen from the tribunes of the soldierS. The
tribunes of the Commoris were not properly magistrates or officers,
for they had no express functious or official duties to discharge. The
purpose for which they were appointed was only to afford protection
against any abuse on the part of the patrician magist1·ateS‚ and that
they might be able to afford such protection their persons were de-
clared sacred and inviolable.

6-11. Hs· tres collaque, etc. All the ancient writers agree that only
two tribunes were chosen at first, but there is a great difference in
their statements as regards the time and manner of the subsequent
increase of number. When this increase of from two to five took
place is quite uncertain, notwithstanding Livy’s statement iu the text.
The next increase, however, from five to ten, did not certainly take
place until the year 457 B.C., when two tribunes were taken from
each of the five classeS, and this number of ten appears to have re-
mained unaltered down to the end of the empne—Duos tantum, etc.
And that the remaining three were elected in the city, after the people
returned. —Ibique sacratam leyem latam. “And that the devoting
'law was passed there, ’⁹ i. e.‚ on the sacred mount, not in the city, as
others again maintained. A Iex sacrata meant in general any law,
the violation of which was punished by devoting the violator, with
his family and property, to the vengeance of some deity. There were
many such laws, The one, however, specially meant here is that by
which the persons of the tribunes were made sacred and inviolable.

· 14-18. Ictumsoedus. Compare bk. i.‚ chap. xxm, line 1.—Antiates
Vols-coa. ‘⁴ 'l'he Volsci of Antium.” The city of Antium was situated
on the sea-coast. thirty-eight miles to the south-west of Rome. It
was the frontier stronghold of the Volsci in this quarter.—Lor29ulam.
Longula appears to have been a small place, not far from Antium,
and a dependency of the lamen—Poluscam. The site of this place,
like that of Longula, is quite uncertain. It was somewhere in the
vicinity os Antium—Coriolos. Corioli, so celebrated from its con—
nection with the legend of C. Marcius Coriolanus, was another small

place near Antium. Its territory would seem to have adjoined those
of Ardea and Aricia. “

20-28. Coriolano. For some remarks on this name, and on the
legend connected with it, consult note at end of chap. ιιι-,δ’ἔνια ullo
meru, etc. “Without any fcar of war threatening from without‚’'
i. e.‚ of any attack from without.—In statiorie. “ On post.’'-Retudit.
“ Beat back.’‘— Coedeque in proxima ur11isfacta. “ And the slaugh-
ter having been carried into the adjoining parts of the city‚” i. e.‚ the
parts adjoining or nearest to the gates. Ooedem ficere must be re-
