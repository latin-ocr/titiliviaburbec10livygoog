14-20. Sacrum Cereris. As the battle took place, according to the·
uni-eformed calendar, ante diem quartam Nonas Sextiles, August the
second, this cannot be the well-known feast of Ceres celebrated on
the nineteenth os April (Ovid, Fasti, iv„ 619), but one mentioned by
Cicero (Leyq. 2, 9, 21). -Ezpers suerat. “ Not a single mati-on had
escaped the necessity of pntting on moui-ning.’' The usual time of
mourning in the case of parents or children was ten months.

27, 28. vainciamque aliam. ‘⁶ Other portione of the province.”
The Roman province of Sicily then was the western portion of the
island—Chusa. As Otacilius had already (chap. xxxvii„ line 41) a
fleet of one hundred and sorry-five vessels, classis must here mean

’“ another fleet.”

 

CHAPTER LVII.

4-6. scribendumque consuli. “ A letter must be written to the con-
sul‚”—Pn'mo quoque tempore. ‘⁸ At the very earliest opportunity. '’—
Per commodum. “ consistently with the welfare.”

7-13. Tm-itss. Supply sant—Ad portam Collinam. In the Campus
Sceleratus, on the right of the road. According to Plutarch this spot
, was inside the city—Quos nanc. “ One of those whom they now
call,'' etc. Quos refers to scriba, not to pontificis. The term ponti-
fix minor was of late introduction. When the real pontiffs began to
neglect their official duties, and to leave the principal business to be
done by their secretaries, it became customary to designate these
latter by the words pontifices minores,- they formed a collegium3
their number is uncertain, but Cicero mentions three.

20-25. Fabius motor. The historiari mentioned in chapter vii.-
Suppliciis. Aschaie for supplicationibus. - Fatalsbus libris. These
fatales libri seem to be different from the libra· mentioned in line 18.
The libri consulted by the decemvirs‚ in obedience to which Fabius
went to Delphi, were the Sibylline books 3 in these, human sacrifices,
especially of Greeks, are less likely to have been prescribed than in
some Etruscan ritual. For the bloody human sacrifices of the Etrus-
cans, compare bk. v.‚ chap. xiv„ and bk. vii„ chap. xv. -Sub terra.
Qualify loom ‘⁶ Into a subterraneous plaee.”—-Jam ante. In the
Gallie war, ten years before. The rite was kept up as late as Pliny’s
time. (Plin., xxviii„ 2, 3, ξ 12.) '

27-34. Quos habebat scriptos. “·Whom he had under his com·
mand, enrolled for the fleetf—Lffm classica. ‘⁸ The legion at-
tached to the fleet 3⁹² not, as in Tacitus, “a legion of marines.”—BI.
Jms‘as Pera. The last dictator rei qermdoe cauam—Ab σηπία, i. e.,
⁵⁴ over seyenteen years of age.”
