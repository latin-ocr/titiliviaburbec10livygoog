PREFACE.

Da. Amnou, at his lamented death, left ready for
the press the text of the four books of Livy contained
. in this volume, together with 'notes on the first and
second books and the first twenty—five chapters of the
twenty-first book. The commentary of that most ac-
oomplished and elegant scholar is given without any
alteration, and will be found topi-esent the character-
isties that have rendered the previous volumes in the
series of Classical authors issued by him such admi-
' rable aids to both student and teacher, and such a
mine for Subsequent editors who have, too often
without aoknowledgment‚ availed themselves of his
scholarship and labor.
As regards the Introduction and the Notes on the
remainder of the twenty· -first book, and the twenty-
second book, Ι am indebted for almost everything of
value to Weissenborn. In addition to his indispen
sable mminentai y I have consulted the editions of
Drakenborch, Wolfflm, Frey, and others3 in one ease
(bk. xxi„ ehap. xxvii„ line 22) Ι have ventured to
adopt a conjectural emendation by Madvig.
The eon ventional spelling, as most in harmony
with that adopted in the previous editions of Latin

authors issued by Dr. Anthon, has been retained in ο

this volume.
