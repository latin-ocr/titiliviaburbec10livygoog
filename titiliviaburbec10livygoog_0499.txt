CHAPTER IX.

2-5. Quia resisterent. The subjunctive, as referring to what the
Saguntiues thought. So immediately after, quia non vicisset-Pro
victo esset. ‘⁴ Were iu their own opinion as good as conquered.'’
Observe again the force of the subjunctive—In minas muri. ‘⁴ Back
upon the breach.” The Carthaginians previously had the breach in
their rear, having advauced beyond it into the town—Inde. The
Saguntinos next drive them from the breach itself ; and finally chase
them back iu conjusiou to their camp.

8-15. Ab Rom 111 place of the more regular ablativo Roma, with-
out the spreposition. (Zumpt, ἓ 398, Obs, 1.)-Qu·7 dicerent. “To
inform them. '’ Observe that dicere, not neyare, is here employed,
since the latter would imply the denial of some assei-tion.—Inter tot,
etc. The more common form of expression would be inter tot tamque,
etc„ the conjunction being added to make the second clause more .
prominent. —Effienatarwm A better leading than ffaeratarum. --
Arma. ‘⁶ Armed baudS.” — operae esse. Equivaleut to vacare.
[Operoe esse. This phrase is usually found with a negative. The

’ absence of any epithet, οι· any substantive like aliquid, nihil, etc„ the

use of esec, not facere, aud the parallelism with the nominative and
accusative, make it probable that operoe is, like ουτω iu ουτω esse, a
dative case. ‘⁴ It is not a matter of attention”= non commodum est.
Baby, Lat· Gr„ ii., 5 1283.]-Apparebat. “It was obvious.'’—Ad
principes factionis Barcinoe. According to Polybius (iii.‚ 15, 8),
Hannibal sent despatches home before the siege commeneed‚ and not
to the leaders of the Barcine party, bnt to the Senate itself. —Ne quid
pars altera, etc. “ In order that the opposite party might not be
able to do anything in favor of the Roman8.’' The common con-
struction is qratificari aliquid alicui, but here pro Romanis is used
instead of the dative.

 

CHAPTER X.

2-12. Inita. ‘⁴ FruitlesS.”——Adcerm sertatum. “In opposition to
the rest of the Senate.’' The common text has adverso senata—Auc-
toritatem suani. “His weight of character. ”--Ε9ἰι. “Pleaded.’'—
suenni-ese, praedsszzsse se. “(He said) that he had urai-ned, that he
had told them beforehand.” Observe the asyndeton, mai-king ean-nest
and animated discourse. —Donea “ As long as,'’—Qm'etura Romana
foedera. “ Would any treaties with Rome continue undisturbed.”
Lirerally‚ ‘⁴ remain quiet. '’

12-19. Juvenoenflaqrantem, etc. Livy often changes, as here, from
the oratio obl-‘qua to the oratio recta, for the purpose of a more uu·-
gent or energetic appeal.—Ex bellis. The proposition is here ειη·
