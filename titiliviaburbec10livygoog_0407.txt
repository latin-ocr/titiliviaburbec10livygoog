sequent period, to the dietatem He occupied the second place in the
state, and, in the absence of the king, had the right of convoking as-
semblies of the people. He appears to have been appointed by the
king.—-In quo mayistratu‚ etc. This is one of the points adduced by
Niebuhr to show the absurd character of the whole story of Brutus,
namely, that he, a reputed idiot, should be intrusted with an office of
30 much importancessby virtue of which he could convoke assemblies
of the citizens, [Tarquin is represented as devoted to family govern-
ment‚ and of such governments the appointment of notoriously unfit
men to high office is the most characteristic fault. (Q).]

31-37. Nequaquam qius pectoris, etc. “By no means indicative of
that character and capacity, which had been counterfeited up to that
day.” Pectus, as here employed, is a poetical form seldom used in
prose-Tricipitini. The father of Lucretia, Spurius Lucretius Tri-
teipitinae—Caci morte filios, etc) “To whom the cause of her death

' must be a source of greater indignation and miset-y thar( the death of

his daughter itself.''——-Demersae. “ Sunk deep in the earth.’'

41—48. His atrocioribus, etc. “By detailing these and, I believe,
other facts still more shocking, which the then heinous state of
things suggested, though by no means easy to be related by writerS,
he so far worked upon the inflamed multitude, that,'' etc.-Juniori-
bus. Only a part of the centuries of the.J'un3'ores were in arms before
Ardea—Praefecto urbis. This was an extraordinary magistrate, ap-
pointed to govern the city in the absence of the king, and afterwards
of the consuls.

The Primores Civitatis mentioned above were LucretiuS, Collatinus,
ValeriuS, and Brutus. The junction of these four in vowing the ban-
ishment of the tyrants has quite the look, says Niebuhr, of an histor-
ical fact, yet this is merely symbolical of the union between the three
patrician tribes and the plebs. It is possible that these very four men
may have represented each his own order, and governed the republic
till the consulship was established, Valerius was a Titiensis, and rep-
resented the Sabines. That Lucretius belonged to the Ramnes may be
inferred not only from the lictors going to him from ValeriuS, owing
to his superior rank, but from his office of governor of the city ( prae-
fictus urbis), which was attached to the·dignity of the first senator, or
the first among the “decem primi'’ of the Ramnes3 hence Lucretius
was interrex. Collatinus, as a'TarquiniuS‚ was one of the Luceres,
and J unius Brutus was a plebeian. The consulate of Collatinus looks
like a compromise with the powerful house of the Tarquinii, to which
he belonged, allowing one of thern, to be chosen by the people, to share
in the supreme power; bnt the whole house was banished shortly af-
terwards. (Niebuhr, H. R„ vol. i.‚ p. 515, seqq.)
