of poetry then for the genuine records of history, ’' i. e., more worthy
to embellish poetic fictions than to appear amid accurate historical
records.

23-29. Ea nec affirmare, etc. In reporting the traditions of the
early ages of Rome, Livy seems less desirous of ascertaining the truth
than of arraying the popular story in the most attractive garb. He

never conceived the project of drawing up a critical history of Rome. ,.

ῥ-Ῡεηία. “Indulgenee.”—Oonsoerare or-iqines suas. “ To impert a
sacred character to their origin. ”—Ea belli ylario, etc. Observe that

ea has here the force of talia—Ut cum suum conditorisque, etc. ·.

“ That when they represent Mars, above au others, as their own par·

tint andlghat of their founder.’'—Gmtoe kumauae. “The natione of
e wor .”

30-35. Sed haec et his similia, etc. ‘shut in whatever way these
and matters like these shall be attended to or judged of, Ι shall not,
for my part, deem of much importance,'’ i. e., whether these early le-
gends shall be attended to diligently or carelessly, or shall be judged
of as true οι· false-Mihi. ‘⁴ 1 beg of him.’' Literally‚ “for me.'’
This is what grammarians term the ethic dative, and is here employed
to indicate eamestness on the part of the mitem—Qum vita, qm·
mores suerint. “What was the mode of life, what were the manners
(of the people),’' i. e., in the earlier end better ages of Rome—Artibus.
“ Praetices,” i. e., line of conduct.

35-39. Lubente. “Declining.'’— Velut desidentes primo. ‘⁴ At
first slightly giving way, as it were. ’' A metaphor borrowed from a
building which at first gives way or yields a little, then sinks more
and more, until at last it falls headlong. Observe that desidentes is
from άεείοῶνε, not from desidera—Quibus nec vitia, ete. He means
that, although men feel the painful consequences of their vices, they
nevertheless shrink from applying any suitable remedies.

40-42. In oeqnitione rerum. “ In the study of history.'' Observe
that illud in the beginning of the sentence is in the predicate—Omnis
te exempli documenta, etc. “ That you behold instances of every kind
of conduct placed before the view on a conspicuous monument-,⁹⁹ i. e.,
put on open record—Inde. We would naturally expect here either
unde or ut inde ,- but inde is employed with intentional abruptness, in
order to render what follows more prominent.

45-50. Sanctior. “ More observant of good morals.”—Nec in quam
civitatem. “Nor a state into which.'' Attraction, in imitation of
the Greek idiom, for nec ulla civitas in quam—Adeo. ‘⁴ So much so
that.”-Abundante³. “ Overflowing.''—Desiderium per luxum, etc.
