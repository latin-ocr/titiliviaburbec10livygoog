CHAPTER XVIII.

1, 2. Numoe Pompilii. It would be idle to inquire into the historica}
reality of Numa. Whether such a person ever existed or not, we
can not look upon the second king of Rome as a real historical
personage. His name represents the rulo of law and order, and to
him are ascribed all those ecclesiastical institutione which formed
the basis of the ceremonial religion of the Romans. Some modern
writers sancifully connect his name with the word νόμος, “ law‚”—
emim Sabinis. “At the Sabine Cures.'' caree, an ancient city
of the Sabinos, was situated about three miles from the left bank of
the Tiber, and twenty-four miles from Rome. In ancient inscrip-
tions of imperial date it is uniformly tex-med “Cum Sabini? an
epithet probably indicating the claim set up by its people to be the
metropolis of the Sabina—commacerat& “ Most skilled.” Lit-

erally, ‘⁴ most consulted about.” Hence the expression for a lawyer,
juris consultus.

6-9. Samium Pythayoram. Pythagoras was a native of the island

“ of Samos, lying off the coast of Ionia, and his birth year was probably

B.c. 608, which is the date adopted by Bentley. According to the
best authoriti he flourished in the times of Polycrates and Tar-
' quinius S 1 effiis (B.C. 540-510). —- Centum amplius post annos.

‘⁴ More ἃ a hundred years after. '’—C‘t'rca Metapontum, etc. “ In
and around Metapontum,‘' etc. The cities here mentioned were all
in Magna Graecia. Metapontum was on the Tarentine gulf, and on
the eastern coast of Lucania. Heraclea was in Lucania, on the river
Siris. Crotona lay on the AEsaruS, in the country of the Bruttii.—
Crotona. Greek form of the accusative. Some editions give the
more unusual form ονοΐοηαηι.-.Ῑυυεηιιηι aemulantium, etc. “ To have
held schools of young men, emulously adopting his tenete.” Compare
Cic.‚ Pro Mur-am„ c. 29: “ Zeno cujus inventorum aenzulz' Stoici nominan-
tm- ‚·'’ and Tacit„ Hist„ iii. 81 : “ Studia philosophice et placita studio-
rum oemuhtus.”

10-14. Qua saum in Sabinos, etc. “ By what fame reaching to the
Sabines, or by what intercourse of language could he have aroused
any one to a desire of becoming acquainted (with his doctrines>.’'
We have given qua fama, ns making a simplet and more natural con*-
struction than quoe fama, although the latter is adopted by Draken-
borch—Unus per tot yentes pervenisset. “ Could a single individual
have made his way through so many nations.'’—-Su0pte ἐρίων inqenio,
etc. “1 rather think, therefore, that through his own innate quali-
· ties his mind had been brought under the control of virtues, and that
he had been trained not so much by forei n branches of knowledge,
'as by the rigid and austere discipline of t e ancient SabineS.'’ We
