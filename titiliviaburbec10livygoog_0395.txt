tion.'’—Parricidio. The offence of Turnus is here called an attempt—
ed parricide, inasmuch as he had intended to subvert the settled order
of things by slaying those wh0, as the representatives of their common
country, ought to have been regarded by him as sacred andinviolable
in their persona—Posse quidem se, etc. ‘⁴ That he could indeed pro-
eeed by virtue of a right long since established.”—In eo soedere tene·
antur. “ Thev are included in that treaty whereby the whole Alban
state, from the time of Tullus, has yielded together with its colonies
to the Roman sway,” i. e.‚ has acknowledged Rome as the head of

the Latin confederacy. As regards the league here referred το, conss

8-14. Utilitatis omnium causa. “ For the sake of the interest of
a11.’'—Quas Anco priua. The relative agrees here grammatically with
vastationes, but referS, in reality, to excidia alsa—Quamquam in eo
foedere, etc. “Although in that league the Roman power had the
advantage,” i. e.‚ the advantage lay on the side of Rome—Ceterum et
capita nominis Latini, etc. “ However, they both saw that the heads
of the Latin nation sided and concur-red with the king,” etc. This
serves to explain still farther why they so easily yielded. Ι

17-21. Ita renovatum foedus, According to Cicer0, however (de
Rep„ ii.‚ 24), Latium was con'quered by force of arms: “ Omne Lati-
um bello devicit.”—Jum·oribus Latinorum. It would seem from this
mode of speaking, as well aa from the allusion to centuries farther on,
that the same military division into classes and centur-iffi, and the
same mode of arming, ete„ prevailed in Latium as in Rome3 and
that Tarquin had not altered this arrangement, though in other re-
spects he did not acknowledge the constitution of Servius—Die certa.

mand.'’—Miscait manipulos, etc. “ He blended together maniples of
Latius and RomanS, so as to make single maniples out of a pair of
manipleS‚ and a pair of maniples out of single oneS.’' That is, out
of a pair of manipleS‚ one Roman and one Latin (consisting each of
two hundred men), he took half of each, and so made up one maniple;
and of a single Roman or Latin maniplo he made a pair by distrib-
uting the two parts of it between two separate new ones,

23. Ita yemiuatis mam‘pulz’s, etc. After this junction of the two
armieS, all the maniples were considered Roman maniples; and, as
every Roman maniple before now became tvm, by joining each half
of it to half a Latin maniple, the number of Roman maniples was q
consequently doubled‚ and Roman centurione were placed over each.
