The Romans of a later age were constantly reminded of Porsena's
expedition against their city by the custom at all auctions of offen-ing
for sale first the goods of King Porsena. Niebuhr conjectures, with
mach probability, that this custom may have arisen from the circam-
stance that, when the Romans recovered their independence‚ they must

considering the later settlement as a kind of second or subsidiary one.

P. Valerius Publicola consules facti, omitting the comuls of one year,
According to Dionysius (v., 2), and the Fasti consulares, Μ. Horatius
and P.Valerius were consuls, and aster them Sp. Lartias and T. Her..
minine. The reading which we have adopted, therefore, is decidedly
preferable to the ordinary one. Consult the remarks of Drakenborch,
