casa—Caput obnubito. This meant that he was devoted as a victim
to the gods belom—Infblici arbori suspendito. “Hang him on the
accursed tree,'' i. e., on the gallows. Observe that infilici arbori is
the locative case, like humi. Many commentators render infelici here
by the epithet “ barren,'’ but that is not the idea intended to be con-
veyed by the term in its present connection. It is rather the fatal
tree, the tree of punishment, the tree on which is suspended an offend-
er deemed accursed. Compare our English expression, ‘⁴ the gallows-
tree.’'— Verberato. Scourging of course preceded hanging, but as

being a matter of minor importance, it is here placed asten—Pomeri-
um. Consult chap. xliv.

26, 27. Qui se absolvere, etc. They gave the accused a trial as a
matter of course, but the only matter they were called upon to de-
termine was whether he had committed the act or not. The letter
of the law allowed of no justification or extenuation of the fact. It
left no alternative to the judge. Hence the force of innoxius here,
“a guiltless person,” i. e., one justified in the act, or without malice
prepense. When, however, the question came before the assembled
people on appeal, then the accused would be allowed full scope in his
defence.

28-38. Tibi perduellionem judico. “ I decide the question of per-
duellio against thee.'’ More freely, “1 adjudge thee guilty of per-
duellio.''—-Injiciebatque laqueum. “And was in the act of adjusting
the rope.”—Auclore Tullo. ‘⁴ Tullus being the adviser.’'—Ita de
provocatione, etc. “ Upon this it was contended respecting the appeal
before the people,” i. e., whether it should be received favorably or
unfavorably.—Patrae‘o jure insiliam, etc. “ He would have punished
his son by a father’s right.” By the laws of Romulus a father had
the power of life and death over his children—orbum liberis. “child-
less.”—Pikz Horatia. That is, “the javelins of Horatius. '' Pila is
here the plural of pilum, and not, as some suppose, the nominative
singular of pila, oe, “ a pillar.” There was a pillar erected, indeed, to
which the spoils of the Curiatii were fixed as a trophy3 but it was
stom the arms and not from the pillar that the place derived its name.
Compare the language of Livy, a little farther on, in this same chap-
ter, “ inter illa pila et spolia hostium‚'' where pila of course is the neu-
ter plural. The position of the Pila Horatia was in the Forum, but
the particular locality cannot be ascertained.

39-46. Huncine. Not to be joined in construction with eum (“ this
same one ''), but the latter is subsequently brought in for the sake of
emphasis. In translating, begin the sentence with huncine by itself.
“This one here whom . . . him can you bear to see,’' ete—Sub furca.
‘⁴ Beneath the fork.’' The furca was a piece of wood, in the form of
