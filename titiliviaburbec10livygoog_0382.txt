the ablativo absolute. Livy means that Servius subdivided the three

old centur-ies of Romulus, which Tarquinius Priscus had merely dou- ⁴
bled as regards the number of men contained in each, into six separate β
cent111·ies.—-Subiisdmn.quilms‚etc. ‘⁶ Under the same names by which

they had been originally instituted.'’ 'rhat is, Ramnes 'niem' et se-
cundi, Titienses primi et secundi3 Luceres primi et secmuii. Compare
chap. xxxvi„ sultfin.

29-31. Ad equos emendos, etc. Not only for the purchase of a horse
in the case of each eques, but also for the maintenance of a groom,
the procuring os a second horse for the use of the latter, the buying
os caparisons‚ etc. Still the sum here mentioned, as well as the tax
laid on υἰάιιω, would seem so large as to be almost incredible‚ especially
when we take into account that one hundred and twenty-six years
afterwards a sheep was only reckoned vt ten asses and an ox at one
hundred, in the tables of penultieS. (Aul. Gen„ xi„ 1.) It is better,
therefore, to follow Bockh‘s opinion, already referred t0, namely‚ that
the sums of money mentioned in the Servian census are not given in
asses of a pound weigbt, but in the reduced asses of the first Punic
War. Compare note on line Ι of the present chapter.—Et‚ quibus
equos alerent, etc. “ And single women were assigned, by means of
whom they might maintain their horses.'’ Observe that by vidum
here are meant single women, that is, maidens and widows‚ not wid-
ows alone. Orphans (orbi) were also brought under this same tax,
This was done, as Niebuhr remarkS‚ on the principle thatin a military
state the women and children, if their means allowed it, ought to con-
tribute for those who fight in behalf of them and the commonwealth3
it being borne in mind that they were not included in the census.—
Hoec omnia in dites, etc. ‘⁴ All these burdens were made to lean off
from the poor upon the rich. ’'

33-38. Non enim, ut a Romtdo traditum, etc. “For the franchise
was not given indiscriminately to all individually, with the same pow-
er and the same right as the other kings had observed it, on having
been handed down from Romulus, but gradatione were established,''
etc.— Vis omnis penes primores, etc. Because in the comitia centuriata
each century, whatever the number of men who composed it, had but
one vote, so that a century of the rich, though very much smaller than
one of the poor, had an equal vote—Ibi εἰ variaret, etc. “If there
occurred a difference of opinion among these, which rarely happened,
the practice was that the centur-ies of the second class should be snm-
moned.” Supply mos fuit before ut secundae classis vocarentur, an
ellipsis easily deducible from what immediately precedes, If, how-
ever, the eighteen centuries of equites and the eighty centuries of the

first class were united in opinion, there was a majority at once, and it
was unnecessary to poll any more.
