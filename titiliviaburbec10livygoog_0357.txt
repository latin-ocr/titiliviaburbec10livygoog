CHAP'rER XXIX.

1-12. Inter haec, etc. The peculiarly elegant and graphic descrip-
tion of the demolition of Alba, given in the present chapter, has always
been deservedly admired.--Proemissi. “ Sent on before,” i. e.‚ to sur-
prise the city in the absence of its defendere—Pavor. ‘⁶ A panic.’'-—-
Effractis. “ Having been burst open.’'— Cursus. ‘⁵ The rush.”--
Silentium triste, etc. These words are not synonymouS. Their silence
did not proceed from quietness‚ but deep sorrow and affiiction, and
their grief was not expressed in shrieks or lamentationS, but buried
deep in their bresma—Deficiente consilio. “ All judgment failing
them.''--' Ultimum illud. “ For that last time. ’' Observe the emphatic
employment of the pronoun‚ and that illud, not hoc, is used, because we-
have here a narrative of past events,

13-20. Ut vero jam equitum, etc. “When, however, the shouts of
the hor-semen, commanding them to depost, grew now more urgent. ''
—Ultimis urbis partious. It is better to connect these words with
diruebantur than with audiebatur, ae would appear from t-he next
words, ex distantibus Iocis. The work of demolition commenced on
the outskirts of the city3 aud the crash, heard from that quan-ter, con··
veyed the news—Raptim, quibus quisque poterat, elatis. “ Having
hastily brought out whatever articles each was able.’' A Graecism,
for raptim elatis iis, quae quisque poterat efferre. The infinitive is omit·
ted, and the relative properly depending on this infinitive is put by

Α attraction in the same case with the omitted antecedent iis. Compare

a similar construction in iv.‚ 39: Quibus poterat sauciis ductis secum.
—Oontinens aqmen. ‘ ‘A continued train.’'—Mutua miseratione. “ With
mutual sympathy.”

22-26. Obsessa. “ Beset.” From obside, ere. —Eqressis urbem.
The proposition here in composition has merely an adverbial force,
and the compounded verb takes at once the accusative-Romanus.
“The Romanss’ More graphic than Romanus exercitus would have
been.——Quadrinyentorum annorum opus. Livy agrees with virgil, who
counts three hundred years from the foundation of Alba to the time
of Romulus (AE'n., i., 272), and Rome, according to the received

chronology‚ had now stood one hundred years. Dionysiae, however, .

makes Alba to have flourished four hundred and eighty-seven years.
On this whole subject consult Heyne, Excurs„ iii., ad Viry. AEn.‚ xii. ς
Niebuhr, H. R„ vol. i., p. 205.-Excidio ac minis dedit. The details
of the Alban war are obviously poetical‚ but the destruction of Alba
itself may probably be received as an historical event, though there is
much reason to suppose that it was the work of the combined forces
of the Latine, and that Rome had comparatively little share in its
accomplishment. The city was never rebuilt, its temples alone had
