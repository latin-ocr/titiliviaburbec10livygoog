Tarquius cannot be received as real history. The narrative is full
of inconsistencies and improbabilitiee. It may suffioe as a sample to
remind the render that the younger Tarquinius, who was expelled
from the throne in mature age, was the sou of the king who began to
reign one hundred aud seven years previously in the vigor of life;
and that Servius Tullius, who married the daughter of Tarquinius
Priscus shortly before he aseended the throne, immediately after his
accession is the father of two daughters, whom he marries to the
brothers οἰ his own wife. Agiria, if, as the Annals gave out, Tar-
quinius Priscus came to Rome at the latest iu the eighth year of the
reign of Aucus, he must at least have reached his eightieth year when
he was murdered‚ and Tanaquil eauuot then have been under her
seventy-fifth3 so that his having left children of tendor age behind
him is iu this view also out of the question. Moreover‚ if Ancus
died iu the fortieth year of Servius, his mother must theu have been
a hundred and fifteen years old. (Niebuhr, H. R.. vol. i.‚ p. 373.)

CHAPTER XLVII.

1-7. Tam vero ia dies, etc. “Thea indeed the old age of Servius
began to be every day more harassed‚ his reign to be more disquiet-
ed.’' Infestus is here used in a passive sense, which iu fact is its
primary force, sinee it is nothing more, after all, than the old participle
of infera—Gratuita. ‘⁴ UselesS‚” i. e., committed to no purpose.—
Panicidia. The murders of near relativeS‚ not acts of parricide.
Consult note on chap. xiii„ line 7.—Nupta. That ia, married nom-
mally, not in reality. She calls her present marriage a nomiual one
from the pusillanimity of her husband.—- Tacita. ‘⁴ In silence. ” That
is, without murmuring against the reigning monarch or taking any
steps to remove him.

11, 12. Pejus. “ For the worse. ” More usually in pejus—Quod
istic cum iquavia est scelus. “ Because in thee crime is associated
with eowardice.'' Observe that istic, the demonstrative adverb of the
second person, is here equivalent to in te.—Quin accinyeris? “Why
dost thou not gird thyself (for the enterprise) ?” Quin, as before, for ’
qui (ablative) non. The passive of accinqo has often, as here, a middle
force. In entering ou a journey‚ οι· other active busineSS, the ancients
were aeeustomed to form a part of the outer robe, which was usually
,loose and flowing, into a kind of ginno, by drawing its outer edge
round the body and tying it in a knot in from, thus rendering the .
garment shorter and more convenient for aetion. ι

 

13-18. Moliri. “To toil after.”-Patris ἱνηαρο, Equivalent to 1
