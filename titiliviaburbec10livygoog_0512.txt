true reading here is rendered very doubtful from the corrupt state of
the MSS. We have given what appears the simplest and most natu-

after Ibmm. -Ιόἰ fama est, etc.' The same story is given, with
some alterations, hy Cicero (De Divina, i., 24), on the authority of the

and 1000 horse. The same number (tria milia supra septem milia)
were sent or returned to their homes. The army before it passed
the Pyrenees had suffered a further reduction of 20,000 foot and
1000 horse. In the passage of the Alps Hannibal lost 18,000 foot
and 2000 horse3 so that, on descending into the plains of the Po, he
had remaining 20,000 foot (via, {2000 Africans and 8000 Spaniards)
and 6000 horse—Ausetanos. Their capital was Ausa, now mque.—
Lacetam'am. This name is uncertain. Polybius makes no mention
of the country. The MSS. all give Aquitaniam. Sigonius conjectured
Lacetaniam. The chief town of the Lacetani was Solsona„ stin so
called, in the middle of Oatalonia.

towns in Spain are neuter, and end thus· Compare Illiturqi and In-

a feminine in is (accusative in im). So we have a little farther on
Iliberrim. The town is now Elne, on the river T ech, which in ancient
times had the same name as the place. Constantine restored Iliberri,
and gave it the name of Helena, whence the modern appellation.--Ad
