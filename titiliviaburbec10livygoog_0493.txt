‘the night,” i. e.‚ he could remain awake during the night, and sleep by'
day, whenever occasion required—Id. quod yerendis rebus, etc. “That
time (alone) which remained after the transaction of business, ” Lit-
mally, ‘⁶ Over and above things requiring to be done.” The pronoun

Superesset. The subjunctive again, denoting a repeated action.—A r-
