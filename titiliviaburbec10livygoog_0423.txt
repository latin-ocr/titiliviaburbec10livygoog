treachery was discovered 3 they were put to death, and the statue was
placed on a higher spot, iu the Vulcanal, οι· temple of Vulcan‚ above
the comitium. (Aul. Ge11.,iv.‚ 5.) The statue still existed in the
time of Pliny (H. N.‚ xxxiv„ 5, ll, ξ 22).-Circumaravit. “ He went
around with a plough.” The reference is to the drawing a furrow
around, not to the ploughing up of land. Dionysius 'says that Scae-
vola got the same quantity of land. Some commentators think that
the domain of the infant republic was too limited to allow such a
grant, but they forget that the whole story is mythical.— —Studim

Subveln'. “ Το be conveyed up (the river).” Literally, “To be brought

his soldiers across the river.” We have given trajiceret, the conject-
ure of GronoviuS, in place of the ordinary reading trajicerent—Adeo
infestum reddidit. ‘⁴ He so harassed. '² Infestus is here used pas-

two miles from Rome. The mile· stenes along the Roman reads were
called Iapides, and also milliaria, and, when no other place is men-

tioned, Rome is to be understood as the starting-point. Sometimes
we have in full ab Urbe, οι· α Roma. Augustus set up a gilt marble
pillar in the forum at Rome, to mark the central point from which the
great reads diverged to the several gates of Rome. It was called
Milliarium aureum. WVhether the miles began to be reckoned from
the pillar itself, or from the city gates, is uncertain—Portam Collinam.
The Porta Collina, at the northern extremity of the' aqqer of Servius
Tulliae, was the most nintheily of all the gateS‚ and lay near the point
vl here the Via Sahria branched off from the Via Nomentana. The Etru-
