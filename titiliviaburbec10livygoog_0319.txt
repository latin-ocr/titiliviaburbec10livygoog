the common but erroneous account. The name Romulus comes from
Rama, not the latter from it. As for the appellation Roma itself,
it would appear to be of Pelasgic‚ that ie, Grecian origin (ῥώμηε
“ strength”), aud to contain an allusion to the martial prowess of the
founders. Rome was founded, according to Cato’s calculatiou, on
the llth day before the Calends of May (i. e.‚ the 2lst of April), the
festival of Pales, in the first year of the 7th olympiad, B. C. 7 51 ; but
according to Varro in the third year of the 6th olympiad, or Rc.
· ι 753.· Varro's date is the one generally adopted.

15, 16. Palatium. The Palatino mount was the central one of the
group, and the first built upon. Its. summit formed an irregular
quadi-angle, and hence the name of Roma Quadrata sometimes given
to the early city. —Muniia There seems to be no good authority for
Niebuhr's assumption (vol. i., p. 287), that the oiiginal city of Romu-
lus was defended merely by the sides of the hill being assumed—Diis
aliis. Observe that aliis has here >the force of ceteris—Graeco. Sup-
ply rita. With uncovered head (Heyne‚ ad Viry. AEn.‚ 8, 268).-
Herculo‘. Hercules probably here takes the place of Deus Fidius, i. e.‚
of Jupiter himself, or else of the Sabine Semo Sancus.

. 17-20. Geryone. Geryon, son of Chrysaor and Calin-rhod, a fabu-
lous king of Hesperia, described as a being with three headS‚ and

possessing magnificent oxen in the island of Erytheia. He perform·
a prominent part in the myth of Hercules, —Nanda thlamegf

the ggrund often indicates the manner or way. -Pabulo laeto. “ Lux-

uriant pasturagest

23-26. Nomine Cacus. The allegorical nature of the fable here re-
lated is sufficiently indicated hythe names of the pertice. Evander,
who receives Hercules on his return from the overthrow of Geryon, is
the Good Man (Εὖανδροςεεῦ and ἀνήρ), while Cacus, his opponent,
is the Bad Man (Κακύς). Some antagonism of early religious sects
probably lies at the basis of the narrative—Avertere. ‘⁴ To drive
off. ” More freely‚ “to purloin.''—-Si ayendo armentum, etc. “ If he
had in (the ordinary mode of) driving forced the herd into his cave.'’
——Deductura aaut. “Were likely to lead.” The imperfect indica-
tive employed in a hypothetica] sentence for the pluperfect subjunc-
tive, deduxissent (Zumpt, ἓ 519). —Aversos boves, eximium quemque,
etc. ‘⁴ He dragged by the tails 'into the cave the oxen with their
fronts turned away (in a direction opposite to it), each one (namely,
of the number) conspicuous for beauty‚” i. e.‚ he dragged the most
- beautiful of them, one by one, into the cave. Aversos here is em-
ployed in a different sense from avertere in a former clause.
