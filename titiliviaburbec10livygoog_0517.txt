CHAPTER ¹XXIX.

1-14. Dum trajiciuntur . . . miserat. Dum, when used to denote
what happens while something else is happening, is usually joined
with a present tense, even when the leading proposition has a perfect
tense, or, as in this case, a pluperfect.—Aloe. In Roman military

· language ala denoted the cavalry of the allies, as distinguished from

the hyionarii equites‘ss and is here used of the Numidian troops as
distinguished from the Carthaginian. - Atrocius quam pro numero.
‘⁴ Fiercer than one would expect from the number of the‘combat-
ants.’'— Proeter nmlta vulnera. “ Setting aside many wounds.''—

Coedes. “The number of the slain.”—Fu9a. Not “flight,” but

‘⁸ confusion.'’-Pars Galhrum. These Gauls were the troops men· .

tioned in chapter xxvi. as being in the pay of the Massilienses.—Hoc‚
etc. “ Thisskirmish, at once the beginning and the omen.”—Summoe
rerum. ‘⁶ The war as a whole.” See, for summa, chap. i., line 2, of
this book.—Ut . . . ita. These words, implying comparison‚ may be
conveniently translated by “indeed . . . but,” implying contrast3
similarly, ance‘m‘tis certaminis is added to Imud sane incruentam by

the conjunction Q, where we would have a contrast introduced by
“ but.'’ ⁸

18-28.'Nec Scipioni, etc. “ Neither could Scipio form any determi-
nation.” Scipio seems only now to have discovered Hannibal's plan,

and to have thought that the army of the Carthaginians would perish ·’ ,

in crossing 'the Alpes—Et Hannibalem. The et con-responde to the
preceding nec.÷Qui primus obtulisset. “·Which had been the first to
present itself.” (Madvig, ἓ 300, b.)—Manus consereret. This is only
Livy's view. Hannibal’s plan had always been to invade Italy, and
it was now too late in the season for him to waste time and men in
Seuthem Gaul.—Inteyro bello. “The entire war,'’ i. e.‚ without a
single battle elsewhere3 the words nusquam ante libatis viribus being
added as an explanation—Censent: Historical present in a relative
clause3 the relative clause here representing a principal clause—Ma-
φὶς iter immensum Alpesque. H endiadys for iter per Alpem—Rem. In
apposition to iter immensum Alpesquffi· “ awful, by repert at least, t'o
troops who knew nothing about it by experience.’'-Metuebat. “A’p-

prehensive (of the future danger),’' while timebat implies sear and ·

despondency in front of the enemy, and horrendam the uneasy feeling
experieneed in presence of unknown perils, very nearly “ awe.”

 

CHAPTER XXX.

3-11. Varie militum animos versat. “ Attempts to work on the spir-
its of his soldiers by different means, namely, by reproving and ex-
