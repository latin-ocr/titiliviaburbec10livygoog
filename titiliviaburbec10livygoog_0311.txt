' at the noble character of the nation and of the her0, and also at their

spirit, ” etc-Fidem sanxisse. ‘⁴ Confirmed the assurance.’'

35-37. Inde foedns ictum. ‘⁴ That thereupon a league was struck. ”
The expression, icere soedus, “ to strike a league‚’' is derived from
striking or slaying the victim sacrificed on the occasion—In hospitio.
“On a footing of hospitality.”—Apud penates deos. The penates
were believed to be the creators and dispensem of all the well-being
and gifts of fortune enjoyed not only by a family, but by an entire
community.

39-42. Utique adfirmat. ‘⁴ Fully confims.”—Stabili certaque sede.
‘⁶ By a fixed and permanent settlement.”—Lavinium. The founding
of Lavinium by AEneas and the Trojans is of course a mere fable. It
would seem more than probable, however, that this city was at one
time the metropolis or centre of the Latin state. Its site is identified
with the modern Pratica. Lavinium appears to be only another form
for Latinium, just as Latinus and Lavinus are only two forms of the
same name—Ascanium. Apposition, instead of Ascanio, by attrac-
tion, as in line 11.

2-7. Turnus. Son of Daunus and Venilia. Dionysius calls him
Τυρρηνός, the Tyrrhenian, as the representative of this race. The
Latin name also would seem to be shortened from Turrinus—Rutulo-
rum. The Rutuli were settled at a very early period in a part of Latium
adjoining the sea-coast, their capita-l city being Ardea. They were a
small and unimportant people. They are supposed by some to have
been connected with the Etruscam, and to have been a relic of the
period when that people had extended their dominion throughout
Latium and Campania—Proetum sibi advenam. “That the new-
comer had been preferred to himself.”——Ducem Latinum amisere.
According to Cam, Latinus fell in battle with AEneas; according to
another account, in a war with Mezentius.

8-15. Diffi-si rebus. “ Having distrusted their own resource8.”--
Mezentium. The true form of the name probably is Medentius, which
will then be connected with the Oscan Meddix. Mezentius was a
mythic king of the Tyrrhenians or Etruscam, at Caere or Agylla.—
C'oere. The amative, or rather locative case. Compare Praeneste,
Nepete. etc. [Seeley regards-tt as a dative after imperitans, since, if it
were an ablative, we ought to have in opulenta] Caere was an ancient
andpowerful city of Southern Etruria, a few miles from the coast of
the Tyrrhenian Sea, and about 27 miles distant from Rome. The
Greeks called it Agylla, which was its Pelasgian name, the place being '
