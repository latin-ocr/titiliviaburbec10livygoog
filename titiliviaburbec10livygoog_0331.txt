was the legitimate representative 'of the whole people, from whom all
other powers emanated.

27. C‘entm-iae tres equitum. These centuries were named after the
three original tribes of whom Livy, as already remarked, says nothing.
The appellations of Ramnenses and Titienses are adjectives derived
respectis-ely from Ramnes and T ities. The third century of equites
ought in strictness to have been called Luc-eremas, this being the ad-
jective formed from Luceres. The derivation of this last-mentioned
term is quite uncertain. We may be very sure, however, that it does
not come, as some suppose, from lucus, “ the grove or asylum. ’⁹ The
root, probably, is to be found in the Etrurian word Lucumo, and they
were, in all likelihood, the followers of the Lucumo Caeles Vibenna
wh0, according to one account, joined Romulus with a powerful force
against the Sabinea

 

CHAPTER XIV.

1-8. Post aliquot annos. The old legend said nothing of Tatius
after his union with Romulus, except mentioning the manner of his
death. Compare Cic.,De Repub„ ii., ῖς Dionys„ ii., 36.—Jure yentium
ayerent. ‘⁴ Comrnenced proceedings according to the law of natione.'’
Ayere is a legal term, and means to set about obtaining redress for an
injury by an appeal to the lam—Plus poterant. “ H ad more weight.’'
-Lavinii. The Roman rites appear to have passed over to the Sa-
bines also, since the king of the latter is here represented as offer-ing
a sacrifice at Lavinium, which was always, down to a late period of
their history, regarded by the Romans as a kind os sacred metropolis,
—Ob infidam societatem reyni. “On account of the insincere nature
of partnership in sovereign power.'’ This is meant as a general re-
mark, and does not contradict what was stated at the close of the
last chapter. Every such partnership in authority contains the latent
seeds of insincerity and faithlessness.

10-15. Ut tamen expiarentur, etc. The Penates of Lavinium were
outraged by the crime, and therefore expiation was made by appro-
priate offerings and ceremon'ieS, among the number of which last
would be ranked a new alliam-e, the old one having been violated.--·
Fidenates. Fidenae was an important city of Latium, on the left bank
of the Tiber‚ and on the Via Salaria, five miles from Rome. Hence,
on account of this close proximity, the langnage of the text, “in ipsis
prope portis.'’ The site of Fidenae is supposed to correspond to the
modern Castcl Giuln'le0.—Occupant bellum ficcere. “Anticipate (the
Romans) by making war.'' occupare means here “to be beforehand
with,” “ to get the start of,’' and is equivalent to the Greek φθάνειν.
As regards the war itsclf mentioned in the text, the account of Livy
