a history of Rome from its foundation to his own time. He is quoted
here by Livy as his authorityssfor three statements: (1) that Hannibal’s
army when he reached Italy amounted to 80‚ooo foot and 10‚000
horse3 (2²) that he lost between his passage of the libone and his ·
arrival in Italy 36,000 men3 (3) that he came down into the coun-
try of the Taurini. Cincius had been taken prisoner by the Cartha-
ginianS, and passed some time at Hannibal’s headquarters‚ where he
heard from Hannibal himself full accounts of the army and the route.
No man could, therefore, have better information. Such informa-
tion, so communicated, ought not to be discarded except on the
strongest possible grounds3 and it is little likely that a man of Cin-
cius’s high official position and practical knowledge either misunder-
stood or was deceived by Hannibal. It is more probable that Livy,
with regard to 'the first statement, misrepresents or misunderstands
Cincius, and describes him as saying “into Italy,'’ instead of “set
out for Italy.” With regard to the second statement, Cincius agrees
with Polybiu8‚ who says that Hannibal crossed the Rhone with 50,000
foot and 9000 horse. and reached Italy with 20,000 men. The third
statement, that the first people on the Italian side of the Alps visited
by Hannibal was that of the Taurini, was believed by many who did
not think that Hannibal crossed by Mont cenis,

xxxv. we find nine days occupied in the ascent, two days in rest, one
day in a march through the snow, four days at the cliff (chap. xxxvii),
three days in the descent3 total, nineteen days, Livy seems to have
deducted the days in which no advance was made-Qui plurimum.
“ Who give the highest number.”—Maxime auctor moveret. “ Would
especially influence me as an authoiity.”-—-Nisi confunderet. “Did
he not get his numbers into confusion by the addition of Gauls and
