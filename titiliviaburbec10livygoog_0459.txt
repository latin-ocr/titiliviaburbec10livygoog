where Coriolanus must have received the mission ; -for‚ as the tradi-
tion most distinctly related, he pitched his camp five miles from Rome,
at the Fossoe va‘Iioe.

nici, for they too were in arms, fell as a province to Aquilius.’' The
consuls dre-w lots for their respective provinces—Cum Vokcis oequo
Marte discessum est. “They came off in battle with the Volsci on
equal terme. ’'

The date assigned to the legend of Coriolanus in the annals is B.C.
490. The inconsistency of this legend with the traces of real history
which have come down to us have been pointed out by Niebuhr, who
has also shown that if the banishment of Coriolanus be placed some
twenty years later, and his attack on the Romans about ten years
after that, the groundwork of the story is reconcilable with history.
The account of his condemnation is not applicable to the state of
things earlier than ΒΕ. 470, about which time a famine happened,
while Hiero was tyrant of Syracuse, and might have been induced by
his hostility to the Etrurians to send corn to the Romans. Moreover,
iu B.C. 458·the Vols-ciuus obtained from the RomanS, as we have al-
ready remarked, the veiy terms which were proposed by Coriolanus
The circumstance that the story has been referred to a wrong date
Niebuhr considers to have arisen from its having been mixed up with
the foundation of the temple to Fortuna Muliebris The name Corio-
lanus may have been derived from his settling in the town of Corioli
after his bauishment. (Smith, Dict. Ant. Bioyr„ etc„ s· v.)

 

CHAPTER XLI.

2-3. Cum Hernicis faedus ictum. This was only the renewal of an
ancient league ; and its stipulation (which is here quite misrepresent-
ed) was that all territory conquered in future by the arms of the con-
federates should be equally divided between the Romam, Latine, and
Hernici. Livy erroneously regards the league as a treaty of peace
at the end of a war3 and Dionysius even enters into a circumstantial
relation of the campaign. The war, however, is a mere fabrication,
derived from the notion that the league was a treaty of peace, and
from a misunderstanding of what was reported of its contents with
regard to the division of conquered territorieS. (Niebuhr, H. R„ ii„
p. 87.)—Partes ἄασε. “ Two thirds.'' The other third, according to
Livy's erroneous version of the affair, was given to the Hernici, which
is a charge brought soon after by his colleague against Cassius—Inde
dinddium. ‘⁴ One half of this ;” i. e., of these two thirds.
