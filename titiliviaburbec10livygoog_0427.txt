gained on the right bank of the Tiber, and that they did not recover
it until a long time afterwards. lle remarks that we find the thirty
tribes which were established by Servius Tullius reduced to twenty
after the war with Porsena, and that it appears clear from the history
of the subsequent war with the Veientines that the Roman territory
did uot then extend much beyond the Janiculum.

The RomanS, however, did not long remain subject to the Etruri-
ans. After the conquest of Rome, ArrunS, the son of Porsena, pro-
ceeded to attack Aricia, but was defeated before that city by the
united forces of the Latin citieS, assisted by the Greeks of Cumae.
The Etrurians appear, in consequence, to have been confined to their-
own territory on the right bank of the Tiber, and the Romans to
have availed themselves of the opportunity to recover their independ-
ence. ·

The object of Porsena's expedition against Rome is said to have
been the restoration of the 'l‘arquinS, and it is natural that such
¹ should have been the belief in later timeS, happening as the war did
within a year or two of the establishment of the republic. But if such
had been its real object, the Tarquins must have been restored to
Rome on the conquest of the city. It is therefore more natural to
believe that this war was in reality a great outbreak of the Etrurian
nations, who meditated the conquest of Latium, and attached Rome
first, because it was the first city that- lay in their way. K. Ο. Miiller
even goes so far in opposition to the old tale as to conjecture that it·
was Porsena who expelled the Tarquins from Rome (Etruslcen vol. i.,
p. 1223 Smith, Dict. Bioyr„ s· v. Porsena).
