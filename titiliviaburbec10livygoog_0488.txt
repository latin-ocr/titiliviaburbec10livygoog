arose from a revolution iu Tyre, where Pygmalion, or Piimelun (the
great-grandson of Etlibanl‚ the father of Jezebel)‚ united with the
people against the tun-istoerncy. He deprived his sister Elissa of her

share in the gos-emment, and put to death her husband, the nigh- l

Priest of Melcarth (the Tyr-ian Hercules) and head of the aristocratic
party, the Sichoeus of virgil, the Acerbul (Zicbarbaal) of other tradi-

tions. Elissa and the aristocracy, unequnl to the task of opposing Α

the king and the people, set sail with a large number of adher-enm,
including three hundred senators, and, landing at the old Sidonias
colony of Campe, founded a town, to which they gare the name of
Carthago, i. e.‚ the new city. Elissa from this voyage derived the
name by which she is best known, Dido, “ the wanderer.”

Cut off from any return to their father-land by politica] antagonism,
the settlers were compelled to look on Carthago as a new home; they
introduced trade aud agriculture, and gradually extended their power
over the native tribes in the neighborhood‚ while their numbers gare
them a predominaut influence orer the other Phoenician colonieS.
This supremacy was contii-med by the siege of 'Pyre by the Assyrian
king Sargon, in B. C. 715, which reduced Tyre from being the head
of the Phoenician confederation; and by the settlements of the Greeks

in Sicily (from Β. C. 736), which drove the older Plioenician colonias 1
into close connection with their powerful African neighbor. To the ¹
last, however, some of the Phoenician colonieS, Utica, for example, <

retained a certain degree of independence of Carthago. By the close
of the sixth century ΒΕ. the power of Carthage, as the head of the
confederate colonieS, and as the mother of numerous colonies along
the African shore within and without the Straits of Gibraltar, extend-
ed from the Greater Syrtis to the Fortunate Islands, and from Corsica
to the flanks of Atlas.

Carthage seems to have long kept up a connection with Tyre.
According to M. Oppert's readings of the cuneiform inscriptions
(agreeing with a tradition in Ammianus Marcellinus), Carthaginian
auxiliaries appear with the forces of Asshurbanipal at the capture
of Thebes in ΒΕ. 666. Iu the year 588 B.C., during and after the
siege of 'Pyre by Nebuchadnezzar‚ a. further emigration to Carthage
took place. After the sui-render of Tyre to Cambyses, ΒΩ. 525, tlze
Phoenicians refused to serve against Carthage. Iu the great Persian
invasion, Β. C. 480, Xerxes seems to have been able to direct the
Carthaginian fleet against the Sicilian Greeks, as well as the Phoeni:
cian fleets against the Greeks of Greece proper.
