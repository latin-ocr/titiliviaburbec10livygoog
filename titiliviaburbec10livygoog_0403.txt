The adytum, in which the oracles vvere delivered at Delphi, was a

subterranean chamber, which no one was allowed to enter except the

priestS, and those to whom special permission was given. In the in-

most part of the adytum stood a tripod over a deep chasm in the

earth, whence proceeded an intoxicating vapor, which was supposed

to inspire the priestess with the gift of prophecy.

CHAPTER LVII.

1-7. Ardeam. Ardea was a very ancient city of Latium, about four
miles from the sea-coast, and twenty-four miles south of Rome. In
early times it was one of the most wealthy and powerful places in this
part of Italy, and it is supposed by Niebuhr to-have been the capital
or chief city of the Pelasgian portion of the Latin nation. In legend-
ary history it appears as the capital of the Rutuli.—Ut in ea νερίοηε,
etc. “As in such a region, and in such an age,'’ i. e.‚ considet-ing
the state of that region and that age. Some regard this construction
as elliptical, and supply fieri poterat, making the meaning to be “ as
far as was possible.” ,It is more natural, however, to render the clause
as we have done, and not to regard it as elliptical at alL—Proeter ali-
am superbiam. ‘⁴ lndependent-ly of his other haughtineSS,” i. e.‚ of the
other instances of his tyranny.-In fabrorum ministerio. “ In the em-
ployment of mechanic5.”

9-13. Si primo impetu, etc. ‘⁴ Whether Ardea could be taken on
the first attack,” i. e.‚ by storm. Si for num—Ubi id parum proces-
sit. Ardea was partly defended by rampartS, and partly by precipi-
tons banks of tufa rock on either side. It was well protected, there-
fore, against sto1·ming.—Satis liberi commeatus erant. “Fut-longhs
were freely granted.”— Comissationibus. “ Revellings.’' Omnis-sari
means properly to hold a festive procession with torches and music 3
and comissatio, a Bacchanalian revel, a festive procession of this kind.
Here, however, in camp, it can hardly be taken in such a sense, and
