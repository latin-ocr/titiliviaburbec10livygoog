16-24. Annorum ferme novem. The genitive of quality, following
immediately after the proper name. (Zumpt, ἓ 397 ; ἓ meo—Pueri-
liter blandientem, etc. ‘⁴ While boyisbly ooaxing his father Hamilcar
(and entreating) that he might be taken with him,’' ete. Observe
the constructio proeynans in blandientem—Afiico bello. The war which
the Carthaginians had carried on with their own revolted mercena-
riae, after the close of the first Punic conflict. It was brought to a
termination principally by the skill and valor of Hamilcar.—-—A ltaribus.
The classical writers exclusively use altaria in the plural, because
such an altar consiste, as it were, of several arae, piled upon one an-
other.—Tactis sacris. His hand having been laid on the offering, or, ·
as Nepos (Hasta, 2) says, on the altam—Nam et, etc. After nam
supply anyebatur, from anyebant which precedes—Concessum. Sicily
was given up to the Romans by treaty, at the close of the First Punic
War. The Carthaginians were also required to pay the sum of 3200
talents in ten years—Inter motum Africae. During the war which
the Carthaginians carried on in Africa against their revolted merce-
narieS, their mercenary troops in Sardinia also raised the standard of
rebellion. The Romans espoused the cause of the latter, and man-
aged in this way to compel the Carthaginians to surrender Sardinia
into their hands. They even had the effrontery to insist upon the
payment of a further sum of 1200 talents as a compensation for inju-
ries which they pretended hassbeen done to their shipping.—Stipendio
etiam, etc. “ A war-contribution also having been imposed in addi-
tion‚” i. e.‚ 1200 talents in addition to the previous 3200talent8.
Observe the force of insuper. The old and erroneous reading was

superimposito.

 

CHAPTER ΙΙ.

2-15. Sub recentem Romanam pacem, “ Immediately after the peace
with the Romane.'’ (Zumpt, ἓ 319.) Observe that recentem here
merely expresses more definitely the sense implied in the proposition
sub3—Per quinque annos . . . novem. These varieties of construction
often occur. Compare bk. xxxv„ chap. xxxiv. ε “Media urbe ac per
soram ,·” bk. ii„ chap. xlii„ line 38: “extis . . . per aves.'’ Five years
denote the whole interval between the close of the First Punic War
and Hamilcar's -erossing into Spain—Qui Hannibalis, etc. The rela-
tive here has really the force of “ even as.” The MSS. give qui, which
has been restored to the text. Other editions have qnoe, referring to
annm—Mors Hamilcaris. He fell in a battle against the Vettones, a
people who dwelt between the Tagus and Anas, ——Puere‘tia Hannibalis.
He was then about eighteen years of aga—Medius. ‘⁴ Intervening.”
-Flore aetaas conciliatas. ‘⁴ Endeared by his youthful beahty.”--
