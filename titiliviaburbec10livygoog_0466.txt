2-5. Leqiones. For mpioe or exorcistas. The Roman mode of speak-
mg applied to the enemy. Compare Horace, Sat„ i.‚ 6, 4.—Prope

so doubtful an occasion. ’' As the Romans before, when sure of suc-
cess against the AEqui, gave up the advantage, it was not likely that
they would now hazard a battle, when they could not be certain of
the successful· 1ssue of ιι, and were besides in such a state of discon-
tent. The enemy therefore calculated upon an easy victory, and even

hoped to accomplish some greater seat than before—for instance, to
take the Roman camp.
