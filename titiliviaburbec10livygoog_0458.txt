30-32. Sed eqo nile-‘l jam pati, ete. “ But 1 for my part can now
suffer nothing that is not more disgraceful to you than distressing to
me, nor, as 1 am most wretched, am Ι likely long to remain so.'' She

her miseries by death. The ordinary reading is ut sim, which Zumpt

Quintilian, however, observes (ix., 3) that his contemporaries Jised the
