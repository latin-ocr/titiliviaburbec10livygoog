were drawn inp—Postremi. To be construed with colliqes-ent ‚ hich

last is to be taken in a reflexive sense—Aquam quadrato. “With

his army in battle arra5‚” i. e., in the form of a parauelogram. The ·

CHAPTEB VI.

2-16. certamem mebunttm “The seeds of dissensioni were sown,”
i. e., between the Saguntinos and their neighhors by Hannibal.—Qnu‘-
bus cum adesset, etc. “And when the same person, who was the
originator of the quari-el, sided with these,” i. e.‚ with the Turdetani.
By litis sator is meant Hanniba—cortanna juris. “A contest about
right. ’‘—l’. Cornelius Scipio, etc. Compare chap. xv. Livy bere
follows the annalists‚ who have led him into an error. The news of
the beginning of the siege of Saguntum must have reached Rome in
the year before, when Livius and AEmilius were consuls. That siege
lasted, according to the best authorities, eight months, and Hannibal
then placed his army in winter-quartem. Early in the spring he set
out from New Carthago on his march to Italy, and took five months
to reach that country, into which he came when Scipio and Sempro-
nius were consuls, that is, in B.C. 218. The more correct view is .
taken by Livy in chapter xv„ where he follows Polybius.—RettuBs- i
sent. From the reduplicated metalium, and hence the doubling of
the t, when contracted. (Madvig, ξ 204, Obs, l.)—Ad inspiciendas.

20-27. Dwementes. “Being in favor of decoeeing.” Dmm is α
often used in speaking of individuals, when it is meant to have the
force of decernere velle—Intendebhnt. “ Were for directing.” This
is the earlier reading, and there can be no doubt of its superiority over
the pluperfect intenderant, as given by some—Temere. “ In a hurried
manner. '’—In poenam soederis rupti. “ For punishment on account of
the violated treaty.”
