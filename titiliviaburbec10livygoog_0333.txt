CHAPTER XV.

1-11. Belli Fidenatis conta-qima etc. “The minds of the Veientes
were excited by the contagious influence of the Fidenatian war, both
by reason of the tie of consanguinity,” ete—Nam Fidenates quoque
Etrusci fuerunt. This is not true. Fidenae was a Latin, not an
Etmrian city. Livy, indeed, informs us elsewhere (i., 27) that the
people of Fidenae had only learned the Latin language from their in-
tercourse with the Roman colonists, but thie statement of the historian
rests on no authority whatsoever. —Infesta essent. “ Should be turned
against.” Festus, as before remarked, is from sero. Compare note
on chap. vii„ line 32.—Justi belli. “Of a regular war.”—-Veios.
Veii was one of the oldest and most powerful cities of Etruria, situate
on the river Cremera, about twelve miles from Rome-Diminuam
ultimae. “ On a final conflict,” i. e., final and decisive.

14--21. De tectis moenibusque. “For their dwellings and walls.”
Observe that tectis here precedes moenibzw, as involving a deeper feel-
ing of interest. Some give de here the meaning of “ from,” but then
the natural order would be moenibus tectisque—Nulla arte. “ By no
stratagem.” As in the case of the Fidenates—Situ ipso. The city
stood on a high hill, difficult of amente—Ulciscendi. The gei-und, as
being a verbal form standing next to the noun, is often joined in ap-
position with a substantive—Ami parte multatis. They were com-
pelled to surrender that part of their territory in the neighborhood of
Rome called Septem Payi, probably from its containing seven villages3
to give up the salt—works which they possessed at the mouth of the
Tiber3 and to provide 50 hostages as a security for the due execution
of the treaty. The district of Septem Paqi thus acquired probably
eomprehended the Vatican and Janiculan hills, and became the seat
of the fifth Roman tribe, the Romilia or Ronzuliaae-In centum annos.
The Etrurians were accustomed to make, not a regular peace, but an
armis-tice or truce for a series of year-e. In the present case the truce Α
appears to have lasted about 60 or 70 years, when war again broke out
between the Veientes and the Romans in the reign of Tullus HostiliuS.

22-26. ane. “ Principally.”—Absonum suit. “Was not in
consonance with.’'-— Creditoe. “ Believed to have been his,” i. e., at-
tributed to bime-Animus. “ His spirit.”—Non condendoe urbis con-
silium, etc. “Not his project of a city to be founded by him, nor of
one to be strengthened by war and peace.” It is much simpler, and
more natural, to give condendoe aud firmandae here their ordinary fut‘
