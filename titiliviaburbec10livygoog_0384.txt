would become the chief place of Rome instead of the Palatine. Ser-
vius took mensures to guard against this danger by admitting the Ple-
beians into full citizenship, and made them in great measure equal
to their Patrician brethren. He did not, however, raise the plebeian
families to patriciali rank, end make them members of the Curiae,
but he created e new popular assembly, which was to include all the
citizens, Patricium end Plebeians alike. Hence arose the Comitia
Oenturiata. But though safeguards so many and so great were pro-
vided in favor of property, the new assembly of Servius confer-red a
great and positive boon on the Plebeians. It must be remembered
that before this time they were outside the Populus, or Body Politic‚
altogether. They were still excluded from the oursae, or Assembly
of the Patricians; and so far as this involved politienl rightS, the name
of Populus was still confined to the old Burgesses. But in reality
the Plebeians were now made member-s of the Populum,- for the new
Centuriate Assembly slowly but surely assumed to itself all the polit-
icul rights which had formerly belonged to the Curiate Assembly
alone; and though it is probable that au laws proposed in the former
must receive the sanction of the latter, end also must be authorized
by the Senate, which was at this time exclusively patrician, in time
these checks were removed, and the Centuriate Assembly became the
supreme legislative body of the state. (Liddell, Hister-y of Rome,
vol. i., p. 55.)

trum. ‘⁶ The closing of the lustrum.’' Lustrum, as here employed,
included everything belonging to the census. The term, however,
strictly means a lustration or purification of the whole Roman people.
And then, as this purification took place only once in five years,
after the censor had completed his censue, the word lustrum was also
employed to designate the time between two lustra.
