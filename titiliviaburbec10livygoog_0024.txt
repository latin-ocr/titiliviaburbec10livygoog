xviii vocantium, eru-ux, ann-romeu nonnas.

Ausim (Praef.)‚ is once used by Cicero. In Livy it is always with a
negative except in vi., 40. The form deum for deorum common in all
writers in phrases like prob deum fidem, Livy uses more widely, as deum
metus (xxi., 4) ς deum beniynitas, ira, etc. (See cie„ Orator, 46.)

5 9.——GRAE01sxs. The use of the adjective or participle as a sub-
stantive appears in Latin at first in philosophica! terme, as honestum,
beatum, utile, and the like; or in terms descriptive of physical quali-
ties‚ as fl-iqidum, calidum, album, etc„ but in Livy more freely, espe-
cially in prepositional expressions—(l) of locality, ab extraneo (i.‚ 28);
in sicco (xxii., 2); ex tuto (xxi., 26); ad vivum, “to the qnick”
(xxii, 17) ; de recto, “designedly ” (i.‚ 11): (2) of time—very rare3
luctus in praeter-ito (xxvii., 2): (3) of other relations ; ex imperato, ἐξ
ἀελπτοῦ; ad irritum (ii.‚ 6); ex vano (xxii.‚ 7).

Livy further uses the substantivated participle or adjective—(a) in
the neuter singular, (1) as a nominative by itseli', deyeneratum, ‘⁴ the
fact that he had,” etc. (i.‚ 53); perlitatum (vii.‚ 8): (2) in accusa-
tive with propositione, propter crebrius lapidatum (xxix., 10) 2 (3) ac-
companied by a pronoun, as ultimum illud (i.‚ 29); eo nefario (ix., 39):
(4) in the ablative absolute with a sentence as subject: edicto . . . ut
bostis haberetur (x., 36) [only twice in Cicero]: (5) with a partitive
genitive, reliquum noctis (ii.‚ 64); in tyanae-uum altitudinis (xxii., 33):
even when the adjective itself isin the genitive, εἰ quidquid humanorum
certi est (νη, 33).-(1)) in the neuter plural (l) with a partitive genitive,
per aversa urbis (v., 29); extrema ayminis (vi., 32) [other cases are
rare]: (2) with au attributive, as confrayosa omnia (xxi, 32); per
invia pleraque (xxi.‚ 35).—(c) in the comparative, in majus (iv., l);
even with a case, in majus vero (αἱ, 32). The superlative is rare,
pro indiynissimo (i.‚ 40). —(d) in the masculine singular, liber et servus
(i.‚ 8); plebeio et humili (iii., 56).-(e) in masculine plural (l) with a
partitive genitive, as expediti militum (xxx.‚ 9): (2) alone, leyentium
(Praef.); condentium (i.‚ 8); scribentibus (παὶ, 57): (3) with a prepo-
sitional phrase, emissis ad coedem (xxxi, 36); while the rule that in
the plural such forms are used of classes only is often violated.

ᾗ 10. Omna Garamans are—(a) the use of adverbs as adjectives,
(1) inserted between a substantive and its attributive; as multarum
circa civitatum (i.‚ 17); duo simul bella (vii.‚ 25): (2) with an attribu-
τίνος aa omnibus circa solo oequatt's (xxii., 23)= (3) absolutely as a.
substantive, satis tuta circa erant (i.‚ 58). —-(b) and of adjectives (1)
for adverbs3 as ferox instat—a use originally confined to adjectives
of *affection 3 oecultum considere jubet (ii.‚ 11): or (2) for an objective
genitive, as dictatoria invidia (xxii, 26), etc.

5 ll.-Susssrau'r1v1·:s in apposition are used for adjectives, as, exer-
citus tiro (xxi, 43) [Cicero] ; advenae cultores (xxi, 30); plebs trane·
fuya (ii.‚ l); pastor accola (i.‚ 7), etc.
