like later porta triumphalis, used only on certain occasions, namely,
armies marching out against an enemy, and returning from their
campaign, passed through it. Hence it was open in war, indicating
symbolically that the god too had gone out to assist the Roman war-
riors, and shut in time of peace, that the god, the safeguard of the
city, might not escape. The “Janus” here referred ιο, however,
must not be confounded with the temple of «Ianus built by G. Du-
ilius in the time of the first Punic war, which was restored by Au-
gustus and dedicated by Tiberius,

10-12. Clausus fuit. “ Has it been shut.” This refers properly
to the later temple, not to the original passage mentioned in the pre-
vious note—T. Manlio consule. He triumphed over the Sardinians
in B.C. 235, and is said to have reduced the whole island to subjec-
tion3 but this statement must be understood with considerable limita-
tion, since the consuls of the two succeeding years were still able to
earn the distinction of a triumph ‘⁴ de Sardis” (Fast. Capit.).—Iterum,
quod nostroe aetati, etc. But, according to Casaubon (ad Sueten. Any. Δ
22), Augustus closed the temple of Janus twice after the battle of
Actium and the overthrow of Antony, namely, after the reduction
of the Cantabri, in Rc, 19, by Agrippa, and a third time about the
period of our Saviour’s birth. This last, however, is rather doubtful.
But still, Lipsius (Elect., i., 22) would infer, from the present passage,
that the first part of Livy’s work was published before the conquest
of the Cantabri.

17-21. Laxaviarent. “Might run riot;''—-C'ontinuerat. “Had
held in check.”—Rem ad ’nultitudinermetm “An instrument most
effectuaL with an nntutored mob, and one uncivilized as in those
times,'’ i. e.‚ as was to be expected in those times—Sine aliquo com-
mento miraculi. “Without some fiction of a miracle.”

24-29. Atque omnium primum, etc. “And, first of all, he marks
out the year into twelve month8‚ which (year), since the moon does
not fill up the number of thirty days in each mouth, and some days
are wanting to make up the complete year, which is brought round
by the sun’s revolution, he so arranged by inserting intercalary
months that every nineteenth year, the space os all the intermediate
years being then filled up, the days coincided with the same position
os the sun from which they had set out.” The year of Romulus is
said to have consisted often mentha, and to have comprised only 304
days3 a period differing so widely from the real length of the sun's
course that the months would rapidly revolve through all the seasons
of the year. Numa therefore increased the year to 12 months, by add-
ing January and February, making it contain 354 days, and as twelve
lunatione amount to 354 dayS, 8h., 48m., and 36⁸„ this so-called year
