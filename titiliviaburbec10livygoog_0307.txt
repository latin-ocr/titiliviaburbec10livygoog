“ Since it is to be tic-aced back.;' Ut quoe is more emphatic thau the
simple quoe would have been, and the subjunctive of course is em-
¹ployed, since the relative implies the reason of what precedes, -Supra
septinyentesimum annum. The common date for the foundation of
Rome is 753 B.c.· This is Van-o's computation, aud is followed by
most authors. The first book' of Livy's history must have been writ-
ten between 29 and 25 B.C.‚ and the composition of the whole work
have been spread over seventeen ysare, or probably a still longer
period—Ut jam maqnitudine, etc. “As by tbi? time to totter un-.
der its own magnitude.” ¹

13-16. Leyenssum. The present participle, especially in the geni·-
tive plural, is sometimes used in place of a substantive where no am-
biguity can result (Madvig, ξ 425).—Proximaque oriyinibne. ‘⁴ And
the events immediately succeeding such 01·igin.ss’—-Ad hoec nova. “To
these modern times.” He means the events of the recent civil ware,
which would possess, of course, 'a stronger interest for the Romans of
the Augustan age. —Proeva⁷mtis populi vires, etc. “ The strength of
a'n over-mighty people has been working out its own ruin.'' Jampri-
dem gives eorfia'unt the force of a perfect. '

16-21. Contra. He means with feelings the very opposite of theirS.
—Tantiqier certe. “ So long at least;'²-—Tota mente. “ With my
whole attention. ”-Omm‘o expers curae. ‘⁴ Free from every care,’'
i. e., free not only from all fear of giving offence by expressing his
opinions too freely, but also from the sorrow which, as a patriot‚ he
could not but feel in recording the civil wars of his countrymen.—
Ser-obeam. Participle again employed as a noun. -Flcctera “To
warp. '’—Sollict'tum ‘⁶ Fun of disquiet.''

21, 22. Ante emiditam condendamve urbem. “Before the city was
founded or was about to be founded. ” The expression ante conditam
urbem, when considered by itself‚ would embrace of course the whole
series of events connected with the destinies of Rome which had pre-
ceded the founding of the city3 but when taken in connection with
the limiting clause, condendamve urbm, it refers merely to the more re-
mote oueS, such as the destruction of Troy, the wanderings of AEneas‚
the founding of Lavinium and Alba, the line of 'the silvii, Evander,
Caene, Hercules, etc. 3 whereas condendamve urbem relates to the events
more immediately preceding the founding of Rome, that is, to the
legende of Mars, Rea, the birth of the twins, Faustulus, Numitor,
Amulius, the Lupercalia, the six and twel've vultureS, etc. There is
no need therefore of making condendam here have the force of a pres-
ent participle passive, and of translating “ before the city was founded
or was founding, ’' although many commentators are in favor of this.
