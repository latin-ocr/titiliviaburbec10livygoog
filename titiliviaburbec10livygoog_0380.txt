Clipeam. This neuter form is also used by Livy elsewhere (bk. xxxiv„
chap. lii.; bk. xxxv„ chap. x.‚ etc.), and occurs likewise in Vin-gil Ι
(AEn., ix„ του). 4

9, 10. Duoe fabrum (πεπτω-ἔω. “ Two centuries of artificers.” These Ι
consisted ofsabrt‘ ferrarii, or smiths‚ and sabra· liquat-ii, or carpentem. ¹
Dionysius says that these belonged to the second class. Cicer-0, on
the other hand, assigns the fabri to the first class, as Livy doeS‚ but
only as one century (de Rep„ 11, 22). The difficulty arising from
these different accounts may be removed by the suppositioni that of
the two centuries of the fabri, one was assigned to each of the first
two classes—Ut machinas in bello ferrent. Lipsius thinks that we
ought to read facerent here instead offerrent, but we must, us Zumpt
correctly remarks, understand the repairiug of old and the making of 4
new engines‚ as implied in their careful transportation.

13, 14. Viqinti conscn‘ptae centuriae. Ten os old and ten of young
mem—Scotum pro clipeo. The clypeus was round, and shorter than
the oblong scutum. It had been given to the first class because they
had also the lorica as an additional protectioni. But, as the second
class had no lorica, they needed the longer scutum as a protection.

15, 16. Tertiae classis, etc. “ He enacted that the fortune of the
third class should be down to (one) of 50,000.” That is, the mini-
mum qualification was to be this sum, or, in other words, their fortune
was to be from 75‚000 to 50,000 asses, We must understand another
censum, governed by in, and itself governing milium. Drakenborch,
however, conjectures milia, and remarks that milium is an eia-or arising
from the manuscripts having merely the abbreviated form of expres-
sion, namely, in L. M—Hoec. Old form for hoe. The ancient form
of this pronoun was hice, hoece, leoco, in which we recognize the demon-
strative ce. The cases ending in c arose from the omission of the e,
which is still found in old Latin, as Itanos legem, hace 1290. This will
explain the obsolete form hoec for Izoe or hoece. (Zumpt, ἓ 132, note.)

20, 21. Hastam et verutum. “ A spear and spit-like jarelin.” The
hasta was intended for close sight, the verutum for hurling at the foe.
The latter had a sharp, round, iron point, like a spit (vm), whence
its name. Its shaft was three and a half feet long, and its point five
inches. The verutum was bon-owed „by the Romans from the Volsci.

It was used also by the Samnites—Quinta classis aucta. “ The fifuh
class was increased (in the number of centu1·ies)‚” i. e.‚ contained
more centuries than any of those that went before, excepting the first. -

22, 23. In his accensi, etc. “Along with these were the super-
numeraries‚ the horn-blo ===== s. and the trumpeterS‚ distr-&med ints
