the addition of tota makes the time “within which ” embrace both
extremitieS. Cf. virgil, “Nocte pluit tota.'’]—Aricia. A celebrated
city of Latium, on the Appian way, at the foot of Mons Albanae,
'and at the distance of sixteen miles from Rome. Some remains of
the ancient( walls still exist near the modern La [tiocia-Jam enim ita,
clam quidem mussitantes, etc. “ For so by this time they used to call
him, muttering in secret, it is true, yet generally so.”—0bnox2·os pre-
mat. ‘⁴ He may crush them when at his mercy.’'

18—21. Quod si sui bene crediderint cives, etc. ‘⁴ But if his own cit-
izens have acted well in intrusting him with sovereignty, οι· if that
sovereiguty has been intrusted to him at all, and not seized upon by
the murder of a near relative, that then the Latius too ought to trust
him with it, although not even so to anslien, '' i. e„ though, not even

“ Destruction.’' Nex is properly a violent death.—A nimos oppresse-
rat. “He had crushed the spirit.''—Pro imperio. “By virtue of
any official power of his own.” He did not as yet possess this over
the Latius, The peculiar meaning of pro here arises from the more
