three centuries.’' The accensi were a body of reserve troops, wh'o fol·
lowed the Roman army without having any military duties to perform,
and who were taken one by one to supply any vacancies that might
occur in the legions. There is considerable difficulty about the pres-
ent passage. The natural meaning of the words in his would be
“ among these,’' that is, that the three centul-ies just mentioned
formed part and parcel of the thirty. This, however, could never
have been Livy’s idea, since then the sum total of the centuries of
horse and foot would have been only 191. We must regard in lais,
therefore, as equivalent to cum his, and must consider the three cen-'-
tui-ies in question as merely belonging to the fifth class, but counted
separately‚ making the whole number of centul-ies in this class to have
amounted to 33. Some editors, viewing accensi as a verb, change tres
to duas, and render as follows: ‘⁴ Among these were reckoned the
horn-blewers and trumpeters, distributed into two centurieS,'' while
others again strike out in, and translate, “ to these were reckoned,''
etc. Both of these modes, however, are objectionable. According
to the explanation which we have adopted, the sum total of the cen-
turies of horse and scot, as given by Livy, will be 194. DionysiuS,
on the other hand, makes it to have been 193, reckoning only two
centuries of horn-blewers and trumpeters3 and this number of his is
undoubtedly more correct thau Livy’S, since, according to Livy’s num-
ber, cases might have arisen in which it would be impossible to obtain
a majority, as 97 might have voted for a measure, and 97 against it.
Moreover, Cicero (De Rep„ ii.‚ 22) describes 96 as the minority.

23-25. censebatur. “Was rated at.’' Construed with the abla-
tive of estimate or value. (Zumpt, ἓ 456). —Hoc minor census, etc.
“Property lower than this comprehended the remaining multitude.”
—Una ,centur-ia. This century, however, was subdivided into the pro-
letarii, capite censi, and, according to some, accensi velati. The last
mentioued were those whose property was at least 1500 asses, or
originally 300 assem the proletarii were those who had at least 375
asses, or originally 75 asses, while the capite censi were all those whose
property was less than the su‘m last mentioned, and they, in common
with the proletarii, were never called upon to serve until the time of
Marius. —Immunis militia. This remark, strictly speaking, applies to
the proletario and capite censi, not to the accensi. For the ablative
with hnmani-e, cf. Zumpt, ἓ 437, note 2.

26-28. Eae primoribus civitatis. “ From among the chief men of
the state. ” They were chosen from the richest and most distinguished
families in the state, plebeian as well as patriciam—Tribus ab Roorzulo
institutis. “Three having been originally established by Romulus.”
Some render “ out of the three established,'’ etc., but then the prep-
osition e ought to hare been expressed. The construction is rather
