yem. “ King of Clusium.” Clusium, now Chi-si, was au inland city
ol' Etruria, one of the most ancient aud powerful in that country, and
oue of the twelve cities which formed the Etrurian confederation. lt 1
was situated about twenty miles to the south of Cortona, and was dis·-
tant eight hundred stadia (ouo hundred Roman miles) from Rome. ξ
Its earlier namo was Camars, which makes it probahle that it was ⁴
origimlly au Umbriau city.

7-13. Satis Eho-tm ipsam, ete. “That liberty has sufficient
sweets of itself‚” i. e., without its being encouraged from without by
suffering this custom of expelliug kiugs to pass unavenged. —Nia‘
quanta vi, etc. “That unloes kings, with as great energy as states
seek it out, with so great protect their kingdomS, the highest things

expense attending the manufac-ture of the article. The object of
this arrangement was to supply the salt to the people at a lower rate.
With surrepta supply recepto, an ellipsis naturally suggested by in pub-
licum, aud after publicum supply ‹erar-ium. The salt-works referred
to were at Ostia, aud had been established by Ancus Marcius. By
the arrangement now introduced they were no longer let by auctiori,
but the state took them under its own management, and carried
them on by means of persons employed to work on the public ac-
count. In retaining omni sumptu we have followed the reading of
all the manuscripts. Lipsius, who is followed by Zumpt and others,
conjectures suanno, and makes the meaning to be, “all the salt being
transferred to the state.” Gronovius gives omne sumptum, making
