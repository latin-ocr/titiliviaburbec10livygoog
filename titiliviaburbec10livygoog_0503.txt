that the Saguntinos would instantly put to death the man who should
be the bearer of such ter-nm, that is, who should incur the odium of
presenting them, though in the name of another.

17-28. Postulabatar autem. “ Now it was demanded.” The ob-
jectionable terms are recitem—oum sinyulis vestimentis. “With a
single suit of clothing.’' Not “ with a single garment‚'' as some er-
roneously render it. Hannibal's object in imposing these severe terme,
was not merely to supply himself with the sinews of war, in the wealth
of the SaguntineS, but also to leave no enemy in his rear sufficiently
powerful to co-operate tc his injury with the Romans. (Polyb., iii„
17.)—Vinci απίηιοε, etc. “That the minds of men are (at length)
snbdued‚ when all things (else) are subdued‚” i. e.‚ when all other
means of opposing the foe have failed—Interpretari. ‘⁶ As the pro-
poser.”—Hospes. The relations of hospitality sometimes existed
between an individual and a whole commuuity.—Proetorem Saqumi-
num. “ The chief magistrate of Saguntum. ’'—Smatus. “ An audi-
ence of the Senate.”

 

CHAPTER XIII.

4-16. Quo nec orator, etc. “ On which Ι would have come neither
as an ambassador of Hannibal nor as a deser-ter,” i. e.‚ since Ι would
have come, etc. The subjunctive with the relative as assigning a
reason or cause. With quo supply itinere—[lh. Alea—Vestra, si
peric-dum, etc. “Through yonrs, if there is danger among you to
those who tell the truth.”—Pro vetusto hospitio. ‘⁴ In consideration
of the ancient tie of hospitality.’'—Nec allius alterius. Alluding to
Hannibal.-Vel ea fides sit. “ Let even this be the proof.” (Zumpt,
ξ 37 2.)—Vestris viribus. ‘⁴ Throngh your own resources.”-Post-
quam . . . est. Au unusual construction, since est is not here the
historical present, which often stands after postquam eo ventum est,

ut . . . sit, for which Livy gives a more concise one. ——AEquam.
“Fair.”

16-27. Ita. “On these conditions.” (Zumpt, ἓ 281.)-Διιᾱι”αείε.
“Be inclined to listen to.’' A latent wish that it may be so is
implied in the mood.-In damno. ‘⁴ In the light of a loss.”—Pro.
‘⁶ Really as‚” Observe the change of preposition.—Ex mayna parte.
Livy more usually has maqna ex parta—Cum binis vestimentis. ‘⁴ With
two suits of clothing each.’' Observe the employment of the distribu-
tive numeral with vestimenta in the plural, as having in that number a
different meaning from the singular. (Zumpt, ἓ 119.) The reading
binis, however, has given rise to some difficulty, since we have sinyulis
vestimentis in the previous chapter. Commentators generally regard
the term binis as an error on the part of the copyist, and Lipsius,
