Tributa being held for twenty years after this time—Absens. Plu-

29-36. Attii Tullii. In the best manuscripts of Livy the name in
written Attius Tullia& and in Zonaras we also find Τούλλιος; but in
Dionysius and Plutarch the form Τύλλος occurs, Tullius, and not
Tullus, is the correct form. Compare Alschefski, ad Liv., ii„ 37 3

4-6. Nondum commisso spectaculo. ‘⁴ The show being not yet com-

fight,” and is peculim-ly applicable to a spectaculum, as in it the com-
