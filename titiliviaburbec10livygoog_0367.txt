ing imayines existed probably as a custom among the patricians some
time before. —A miqrant. The verb arniyrare occurs nowhere else,
but still it is formed after the analogy of avobzre„ etc„ and is given by
the manuscripts,

30-32. carpento. ‘⁴ In a chariot.” [carpento. The more regular
construction in prose is with a preposition‚ but the simple ablative is
not uncommon in Livy in imitation of the poem, the designation of
place being regarded somewhat in the light of manuel-‚J The carpen-
tum was one of the earliest Roman carriages of which we find men-
tion. Properly speaking, it was the vehicle in which Roman matrons
were allowed to be conveyed in the public festal processionS. Of its
form we know little. It is represented on a medal struck in honor
of the elder Agrippina, after her death. It had two wheeIS, and was
commonly drawn by a pair of mule8‚ more rarely by oxen or horseS.
Livy uses the term here to indicate a mere travelling-chariot, and,
. what is more, without any top, whereas on the meda] just mentioned
it has a richly adorned covering. —Suspensis demissa kniter alis.
“Descending gently on poised pinion8.’' suspendere is used strictly
of weighing in a balance3 hence to hold up in the air, in a state of
equilibrium‚ and is thus applied here to a bird poised in mid-air.—
Velut ministerio divinitus missa. “As if sent by divine command to
perform that office.”

35- 37. Per-ita, ut vulyo Etrusci, etc. The Etrurians were remark-
ably addicted to divination‚ and had reduced it to a complete system,
but then this knowledge was confined entirely to the ruling caste, or
LucumoneS‚ to which Tanaquil belonged. These Etrurian chiefs
were the persons from whom the young Roman nobles received in-
struction in this sacred science. Livy’s language therefore must not
be regarded as applying to the whole nation indiscriminately.—E'a-celsa
et alta sperare. “To entertain high and lofty hopes.''—Eam alitem,
etc. “That such a bird had come from such a quarter of the sky,
and the messenger of such a deity‚” i. e., of Jupiter, to whom the
eagle was sacred. All these were omens of future greatneSS.—-Circa
summum culmen hominis, etc. ‘⁴ That it had exhibited an omen aroqnd
the highest part of man; had lifted the ornament placed on the head
of man.”

41-43. L. Tarquinium Priscum. Niebuhr takes this summme, Priscus
(a regular Latin one), and founds upon it one of his arguments to prove
that the Tarquins were not of Etrurian, but of Latin origin. His argu-
ments, however, have not much weight‚ and certainly are insufficient
to refute the universally received belief of antiquity in the Etrurian
origin of the Tarquins, which is moreover confirmed by the great
architectural works undertaken in the time of the last Roman kingS‚
