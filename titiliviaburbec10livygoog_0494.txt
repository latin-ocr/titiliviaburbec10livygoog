CHAPTER V.

1-12. Ex quo ἁ da: at declarata Hannibal entered on hie eom-
mand in the year 221 13.c., and devoted this year and the two fol·
lewing to the extension of the Carthaginian dominion in Spain, aud
the preparation of means for his invasion of Italy. Aa Hannibal was
nine years old at the time of hie father'e departure for Spain, and as
Hamilcar and Hasdrubal had governed in succeesion for serenteen
years, he must have been twenty-six years of age when he assumed
the command. -Sayuntinis infirm bellum statuit. His object was t'o
provoke the Romane to war by besieging Saguntum.—Qm’bus oppuq·
mandis, etc. ‘⁴ And since the Roman arms would undoubtedly be set
in motion by (his) attacking these.” The ablative of the gerundivo
here takes the place of a conditional clause ζ “if he were to attack
these”).—-Movcbautur. The indicative, for moverentur, the reference
being to an act which would certainly take place, and which is sup-
posed therefore to be, as it were, already begun and proceeding.
(Madvig, ἓ 337, Oba. 1.)--Olcadum. 'rhe Olcades were a people of

at a later date by the Oretani—In parte. “ Within the territory. ⁷⁹-

and in regular order.-Jun9endoque. “ And by contiguous junction,”
ί. e., and by joining to one another contiguoue lande. Supply finiti-

13-19. Cartalam. Many editions have Carteiam. Polybius names
the place Althoea (Ἀλθαία). Its site is unknown. We must not
confound this city, however, with Carteia, near Calpe, or Gibraltar.
—Quo metu. For cujus rei metm—Stipendia imposito. The ablative
absolute is here employed to express a circumstance which does not
precede, but follows the main action. (Madvig, ἓ 431,‘0bs. 2.)—
