umes. “ Yon may date from this period.’'-Omm'a jura. “All their
privileges.” Except those connected with religione matter& These
were vested in a Rex Sam-onam, as mentioned in the next chapter.—
Omm’a insiynia. Except the crown and sceptro. These were only seen
in triumph8‚ and on great festal occasione, as, for instance, in the cel-
ebration of the Ludi Circenses, etc.—Ne εἰ artabo fasces haberent, ete.
A concise form of expression, instead of ue duplicaretur terror, qm·
duplicatus esset, εἰ ambo fasces haber-ent. Each consul had twelve lic-
tora with the fasces, bnt it was ordained that, while they were at
Rome, only one of the consuls shonld be preceded by the lictore, and
that the other should be attended merely by a single accensus. This

arrangement was to be for month and month about. When they were

not at Rome, however, bnt at the head of armies, each consul was pre-

ceded by his own lictors3 and they then also retained the axe in the

fasces, whereas in the city the axe was removed. The finge, how-

ever, always had the axe both at home and abroad. Compare note

were vacated by the banishment or emigration of the adher-ems of
the Tarquins. On the other hand, in mentioning that Brutus filled
up the number of the Senate to 300, Livy omits to state that, among
the equites who were so admitted, there were some plebeians als0,
belonging to the richest familias of the commons. (Niebuhr, H. R„
vol. i.‚ p. 526.)—Qm· patres quique conscripti essent. “These who
were patres and those who were oonscm'pti,'' i. e., those who were old
members, and had obtained this rank by inheritance‚ and those who
were new membem, having recently been enrolled among or added to
the old once. According to this explanation, the Senute was snm-
moned, and was also addressed by speakerS, as “ Patres, Conscripti ''
(i. e., Patres et Con-scripti), the connecting conjunction et being omit—
ted, as it often is in ancient formulae. But in later times it. was for-
