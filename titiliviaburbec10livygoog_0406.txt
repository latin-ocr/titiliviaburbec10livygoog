CHAPTER LIX.

2-13. ,Manuale ωπον-ι. Δ much better reading than manantem em-
ore, since it bringa the circumstance more prominently &siward—Me
exsecuturum. ‘⁶ That 1 will put-sue.” Exequi ia more commonly found
with the accusative os the thing (scil. injur-iam) than of the person,
and hence some have conjectured here nacmm5 but perhaps Livy
intended here to express a long-continued putauit and complete over-
throw of tyrannical powee.—Stupentibuae miraculo rei, etc. “ Lost in
amazement at the strangenese of the hiet, from what canae this new
intelligent-0 (may have sprung) in the breast of Brutus, ''—Jan inde
vocantem, etc. “ From this time now summoning them,” etc.

14-19. Iasorum. The forum of Collatia—Miraculo rei nocoe atque
indiynitate. “By the surprising and revolting character of the strange
fact. ”-- Castiqator lacrimarum, etc. “ The rehnker of their tears and
unavailing complaints‚” i. e.‚ who rebuked them for their teate, etQ-›—
Capiendi. Depending on ‹ructon-Adversus hostilia ausos. ‘⁶ Against
those who had dared to perpetrate the deeds of foes in open warfare,”
i. e.‚ what usually only an enemy in open war attempta to do.

21-27. Pari proesidio, etc. “ An adequate guard being left at the
gates at Collatia, and sentinels being planted‚'’ etc. Pars· meane, such
as the emergency required. Many, however, render it, “ Equal to
the number that went to Rome;'‘ but there appears to be no good
reason why an even division of the forces should he made; and, be-
sideS, Collatia, from its comparative insignificance‚ did not require
aa many men to keep down Tarquin's party aa were necessary to be
sent to Rome. Gronoyius conjectures pars proesidio relicti, but the
explanation we have given to pari rendere any emendation unneces-
sary.-Reyihus. “ To the king and his sona’‘-Pat·orem ac tumultum.
“Panic and confusion. ’‘-Rursus ubi anteire primores, etc. “On
the other hand, when they see the chief men of the state moving
at the head (of the throng), they think that, whatever it may be, it is
not without some good reason.”—Motmn anirum-um, “Excitement

of feeling.''

29, 30. Praeco. As the comitia curiata were summoned by a lictor,
and the centuriata by a. cornicen, the gathering of the people here re-
ferred to could have been neither of these, although Dionysius (ἰν. 84)
makes it to have been the formem—Tribunum ochram. ‘⁶ The tribune
of the Celeres‚” i. e.‚ the commander of the cavalrff. This office‘r stood
m the same relation to the king as the vnaqister equitum did, in a sub-
