secking the throne by evil means. ”—Pn‘mores patr-um. Most proba· ὅ
bly patres majorum qemium, since those tainorum yentium were partisans ¹
of Tarquinium-Neque enim ad jus requi, etc. “For neither as re-
garded a title ιο the throne had he anything ιο allege save force.''
A species of oxymoron, mere force conferring a very precarious title.

11-16. Eo accedebat, etc. “To this was added the circumstance
that,” etc. The more usual form of expression is quod instead of ut.
—Coqnitiones capitalium rerem, etc. ‘⁶ He used to take cognizance of
capital cases alone, by himself, without any advisere.” Consiliis is
here the abstract for the concrete, and the allusion is ιο counsellors
or advisere taken fromthe ranke of the Senatu—Perque eam eausam.
“ And under that pretext.”—Sed unde. “ But persons from whom.”

22-29. Domesticis consiliis. Opposed to public ones.—00noiaabat.
“ He strove to attach ιο himself. ’‘—Pereyrinis opibus. “By foreign
influence.”—octavio Blamilio Tusculano. Sigonius thinks that we
ought ιο read octavo, since otherwise we would have a nomen used as
a proenomen. Gronovius, however, correctly remarks that what was
a nomen at Rome might be used as the proenomen of an individual
among some of the other states of Italy.--Ab Ulixe deaque Circa ori-
undus. The form Ulixes is less usual than Ulyssem So again Circa,
for Circe, is the genuine but less usual Latin form, through the AEolic
Greek. The house of the Mamilii traced their name and origin to
the mythical Mamilia, the daughter of TelegonuS, who was regarded
as the founder of Tusculum, and was the reputed son of Ulysses and
Circe. Compare Dionys„ iv„ 453 Festus, p. 130, ed. Miiller.

 

CHAPTER L.

1-6. Auctor-itae. “ The influence.”—In diem certam. Good prose
writers make the singular of dies much more frequently masculine
than feminine. The latter gender, generally speaking, is used only
when dies deuotes duration or length of time, and in the sense of a Ι

 

fixed and appointed day, as in the present instance—Lucum Ferm- ‘
tinoe. A sacred grove, with a fountain and shrine of the deity of the
same name, celebrated as the place where the cities composing the
Latin league used to hold their general assemblieS. It was in the
neighborhood of Alba Longa, and there can be little doubt that its

site is correctly fixed by Gell and Nibby in the deep valley or ravine

near Marivm, where there is a copious fountain, giving rise to a small
stream, which flows into the Tiber below Rome—Diem quidem serva· ·
vit. “ Kept the day indeed. ’' l

7—17. Multa ibi jactata sunt. “ Many topics were thrown out!
