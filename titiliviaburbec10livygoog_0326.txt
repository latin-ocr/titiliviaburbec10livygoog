According to Niebuhr (H. R„ vol. i.‚ p. 289 seqq.)‚ ou what was
called in early times the Agonian hill, the Sabines seem to have es-
tablished a town, of which the Capitoline may be considered to have
been the cit-adel, separated from the town Roma on the Palatino by a
swamp. 'rho name of this town he thinks was Quirium. and of its
inhabitants Quiritem and the later name of the Quirinal was derived
from that of the town. Roma and Quirium were then two distinct
towns. The poetic story of the rape of the Sabines, and the conse-
quent war, may represent that at oue time there was no right of in·-
termarriage between the two cities, and that the oue which had been
before in subJection (Niebuhr conjectures Roma to have been the snb-
ject city) raised itself, by arms, to au equality of civil rights, and even
to a preponderauce.
