whole Alban army engaged in the campaign-Princeps. “Fore-
most.” Aa in triumph.—-Triqmeina. “Of the three brotherS.'’—
Portam Capenam. So called because the Appinn Way passed through
it, leading to Capua.-l'aludamento. “The military eloak.” The
paludanoentum was a military cloak, worn not only by a Roman gen-
eral when commanding un army, but also by his principal officers
and personal attendants, in contradistinction to the saqum of the
common soldiers. Livy's employment of the term here is therefore
correct enough.

11-14. Movet. “Mores with wrath.” Supply ira—ama imma-
turo amore. “With thy ill-timed love. ” Immaturo has here the force
of intempestivo. — Qum-umque Romana, etc. ‘⁴ Whatsoever Roman
woman shall lament a foe.‘’ Some of the early editions have Quae-
cumque Romnum luyebit hostem, but Romanum hostem in this sense is
hardly, if at all, good Latin.——Facto obstabat. “ Was a counterbal-
ance to the deed,” i. e.‚ outweighed its enormity.-Tamen raptus in
jus ad reym. “Still he was hurried to justice before the king.”—
Tam tristis inyratique, etc. “ Of a judicial proceeding so melancholy
and unpleasing towards the lower erdere, or of punishment in accord-
ance with that proceeding‚’' i. e.‚ of the punishment consequent there-
upon. The king himself wished to avoid the odium of so unpopular a
trial, well knowing that condemnation must necessarily= follovv, and
therefore turns the whole matter over into the hands of duumviri.
The manuscripts have ad secundum judicium, but as this is unintelli-
gible, some editors conjecture ac for ad, while others prefer aut. We
have given the latter with Drakenborch.—Duumviros qui Horatio, etc.
“ Ι appoint duumviri to try Horatius for perduellio.’' We have here
a departure from the ordinary construction, the verb judicare com-
monly taking the genitive of the crime alleged. In the earlier periods
of Rome every act of an individual which was injurious to the state
or its peace was called perduellio. Most commonly it refers to high-
treason, under which head the present offence would be classed‚ since
the act of Horatius, in killing his sister, was regarded as a usurpation
of the prerogative of punishment, and hence as a crime against the
state.

22-25. Lex horrendi carminis erat. “The law couched in a seat-511
form of wordS.'' Compare note on chap. xxiv„ line 27.—Duumviri
perduellionem judicent. ‘⁴ Let the duumviri try the question ofperduel-
lio.’' Some editore, both here and in the previous passage, give judi.
care the meaning of “ to pass sentence‚'' than which nothing can be
more erroneons. The trial of course must come first.—-Provocarit.
The accused had a right of appeal from the (lecision of the duumviri
