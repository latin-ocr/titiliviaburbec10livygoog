15-23. Mortuus Omnis. The death of Tarquinius at Cumae is, as ’
Niebuhr remarks, certainly historical. ' But the only reason for plac-
ing it in the year 259 waS, no doubt, because the serment among the
commenalty at Rome broke out in that year3 and the tradition ran
that so long as he lived the patricians kept within boundS. Aristo-
demuS, whose name is infamous among the earlier Greek tyrants for
his atrocities, became the heir of his illustrious client3 andsssome years
after detained the property of the republic in lieu of his claims to that
of the Tarquins. (Niebuhr, H. R., vol. i., p. &OQ—Luxuriosa. “Im-
moderate. ’'— Oui ad eum diem, etc. ‘ ‘ To whom, 'up to that day, defer-
ence had been paid (by them) to the utmost of their power. ’‘—Siynia
colonia. Compare bk. i.‚ chap. lvi„ line 15. —Suppleto numero' cohm-
rum. “ The number of the colonists being filled up.’' Being a mili-
tary outpost on the borders of the Volscian territory, it had suffered
from the incursions of that people.—-Tribus una et viyinti factae. By
the addition, probably, of the Claudian tribe. Consult note on bk. ii.,
chap. xvi„ line 14.-AEdes Mercurii. Compare bk. ii., chap. xxvii„
line 19.—Idihus Maiis. “On the fifteenth of May.’' The Ides fell

on the 15th of March, May, July‚ and October, and on the 13th of
the other months.

 

CHAPTER XXII.

3-11. Quae ‚mittar-ent. ‘⁶ Which they were in the act of sending.”
Not “ would have sent‚'’ which would have required misissent—Hac
ira. “Thi-ough resentment at this.” Livy seems neither here nor
at recens, farther on, to have considered that four years had already,
according to his own account, elapsed since that time. He appears
to have had in view the annalists who placed the battle of Regillus
three years later. -- Consilii poenam non metuentes. ’ᾖ Dreading no
punishment for mere intention.”—-Pometia. In the sixteenth chap-
ter of this book mention is made of a war against the Aurunci, which
appears identical with the one here described as carried on with the
Volsci. lt is impossible, as Zumpt remarks, that both could have
been carried on, for in the sixt-eenth chapter Pometia was almost an-
nihilated, whereas bere it appears again as a considerable town. Livy,
therefore, had, as Zumpt thinks, several ancient annalista before him,
some of whom placed this event in the one year, others in ‘the other.
Without himself deciding as to the true date, he repeats the same oc-
currence in the separate yearS, in order to pass over nothing which
was given as a fact in the legendary history.

13-19. Suum inqenium. “Their natural disposition‚” i. e.‚ their
fondness for wat-like outbreaks.—Hernicis. The Hernici, as we have
before remarkcd, were a people of Central Italy, bordering on the
AEqui towards the north, and on the Volsci to the south and east:-
