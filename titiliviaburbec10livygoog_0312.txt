of Pelasgian origin. It received the appellation of Caere (probably
Cisra) from the Tyrrheniam when they conquered it. The modern
village of Carvetii lies just without the line of the ancient walls.—
Impem‘tcms, This frequentative form is often employed to indicate
long-continued away.—Jam inde ab initio. ‘⁶ From the very first. '’
Jam inde generally means “ever since‚’‘ as Jam inde ab Aristotele.
‘⁴ Ever since the time of Aristotle.’'—Nimio plus. ‘⁸ More by'far.”—
Secia. Taken proleptically, the alliance being the result of the

17-24. Sub eodem jure. “ Under the same rule.’‘—Latiuos utram-
que qentem appellavit. This, of course, is erroneouS. The Latini
were not so called either in 'the way here mentioned, nor from a
monarch of the name of Latinus. The connection which has been
generally recognized between Latini and Lavinium as also between
Latinus and Lavim, seems to point to the existence of an old form,
Latvinuae. (DonaldsomVar-wnianus, p. 6.) In like manner, Latium is
not derived from ἁιιεο, but means the land of the Latini. —His αηίηιίε
populorum. “ Upon this state of feeling on the part of the two com-
inunitie8.”--Ut jam non terras solum, etc. The Etrurians had at au

· early period extended their dominion over the greater part of Italy,

from the Alps and the plains of Lomb ·dy, on the one hand, to
Vesuvius and the Gulf of Surrentum on he other. Contemporary
with this great extension of the Etruscan ouer-by land was the pe-
riod of their maritime and naval suprem cy. The Tyrrheniam, as
the Greeks called them, were also a bol and hardy race of navi-
gators3 they are repeatedly mentioned a fitting out great fleets for
naval warfare3 and they exerciscd an almost undisputed supremacy
over the sea which derived from them the name of the Tyrrheniam—-
Fretum Siculum. Now the Strait of Messina.

26-29. Secundum inde proelium Latinis. “ Thereupon (ensued) a
successful battle for the LatinS.’' Crevier maintains that secundum
here means “ the second,” and that ultimum is opposed to it. But
the truth is, this was really the first battle for the Trojans and Abo-
rigineS, now incorporated, according to Livy, under the common name
of Latini—Situs est. “ He lies interred.'' The idea which sino car-
ries with it, when thus employed, is that of repose or rest. Diony-
sius says that the body of AEneas was not found after the battle, and
it was believed that it had been carried up to heaven, or that he had
perished in the river Numicius, (Dion. nal„ i.‚ 64.) A Hmffin
therefore (ἡρῶον), according to the same authority, was erected to
his memory.

Quemcunque etam dici, etc. “ By whatever appellation it is right
and pious for him to be called.” AEneas, being now deified, could
not be called by his human name; while in speaking of his being
