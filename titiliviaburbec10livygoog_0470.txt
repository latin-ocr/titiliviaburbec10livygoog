466 noras.

42. Vestibula. “The court-yard.” Vnt-'buhun has here its proper
meaning. 1t did not, strictly speaking, form part of a bnilding,
but was a vacant space before the door, forming a court, which
was surrounded on three sides by the structure, and was open on the
fourth to the street. The two sides of the building joined the street,
but the middle part of it, where the door was placed, was at some
little distance from the street. The ordinary meaning of the term
‘⁸ entrance-hall,” within the house-door, but without the sleeping-
apartments, does not of course apply here.

Aulus Gellius (xvii, 21) says that the three hundred aud six Fabii
perished alony avith their sam-‘lies on the Cremera, and hence Niebuhr
(vol. ii., p. 193) infers that they were not merely an udvaueed post in
an enemy’s country, occupying a fort there for the sake of ravaging
the territory of the foe, but that they formed a regular settlement on
the river with their wives aud children, aud that eventually a town
would hare sprung up there.

 

CHAPTER XLIX.

1-11. Manat. “ Gradually swendet-Sabus& “Had undergone‚”
i. e., had taken upon themselves—In privatam curam. “ Into a mat·
ter of private conoern.” This is said with somewhat of rhetorical ex-
aggei-anon, since the state still really carried on the war. Compare
line 38 seqq. of the present chapter. —Si sint. “ If there be besideS.”
—Postera die. Livy very rarely uses dies iu the feminine gender.
Drakenborch says only in four places, of which the present is one,
und yet even in these the MSS. vary, so that he himself gives the
masculine the preference here. We have followed, however, Alschef-
ski and Zumpt—Palmalacum. “ In his paludamentum, ’⁵ i. e., in full
military costume. Consult note on bk. i., chap. xxvi„ line 10.-A0-
ceptus in medium. ‘⁴ Being received into the centre.”

14-21. Sex et trecenti. These were the Fabii proper, or members
of the Fabian house; but there were besides these, as Festus informs
us, five thousand clients‚ since it would require a large number of
men to maintain a military post in the immediate vicinity of the foe.
Perizonius (Animadv. Hist„ c. 5) thinks that the number of the Fabii
is greatly exaggerated, and no doubt he is right, since the whole ac-
count has evidently been drawn from some family lay of the Fabian
house. Compare the remarks of Niebuhr on this whole subject
(R. H.. vol. ii.‚ p. 195).—Quorum neminem, etc. Rhetorical exaggera-
