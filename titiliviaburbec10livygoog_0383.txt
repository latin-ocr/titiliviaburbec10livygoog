40. Nec mirari oportet, etc. “Nor ought we to wonder that this
arrangement, which at present existe, since the tribes were increased
to thirty-five, their number being (virtually) doubled by means of the
centuries ofjuniors and seniorS, does not agree with the amount (of
centuries) established by Servius Tullius.” The meaning of these
obscure but very important words appears to be as follows: It ought
not to occasion any surprise that the Servian constitution, thus far
described, does not agree with the arrangement which exists at the
present day, since the latter first came in when the number of tribes ι
was increased to thirty-five (literally‚ “'after thirty-five tribes were
filled up '’), that is, after A.U.C. 513, and when these tribes were
virtually doubled by the centuries of younger and elder men3 whereas
Servius made only four tribe5‚ and these limited to the city, and did
not connect them in any way with the centnn‘eS. Livy does not say
that since A.U.C. 513 there have been seventy centurieS, but in effect
seventy tribes (i. e.‚ half-tribes). About the number of the centuries
he says nothing, partly because he considers it too well known to re-
quire any mention, and partly because he is here merely considering
the discrepancieS, not the points of resemblance, between the two con-
stitutions, As to the question about the manner in which the com-
bination of the Comitia Centuriam and Tritum was effected, consult
Smith, Dict. Ant„ ε. v. Comitia.

44-46. Quadmsarzam enim, etc. The four city tribes were called by
the same name as the regions which they occupied, namely, Suburana,
Esquilina, Collina, and Palatina, Livy, it will be observed‚ says noth-
ing about the number of the country tribes, and we are indebted to
Fabius Pictor, the oldest of the Roman annalists, and to Varro (ap.
Non„ p. 43) for the number, namely, twenty-six.—Trib·us a tributo,
It is more natural to suppose that tributum was so called because paid
by the tribes (Vari-0, L. L„ ir„ 36.) The term originally referred to
the three Romulian tribes, Ramnes, Τι’τίεε, and Lucerea——Nam ejus quo-
que (equaliter, etc.⁴ “ For the system of contributing this τοο, in even

proportion, accordingto every one's property, was established by the
same monarch.’'

We have already spoken of the growth of the Plebs or Commons,
and shown how Tarquinius Priscus raised the richest and most pow-
erfnl houses of this class to be members of the Patrician tribes.. But
still the mass of the plebs continued to live as before upon the Aven-
tina, without having art or part in the affairs of the Roman people.
The Populus, or Body Politic‚ still consisted only of Pati-icians3 bnt
the Plebeians were.. every day increasing in numbers and wealth‚ and
it was tow that if they were much longer shut out from all
part in public affairs, they might rise against the Patricium, and take
by force what they could not get as a free gift, and so the Aventina
