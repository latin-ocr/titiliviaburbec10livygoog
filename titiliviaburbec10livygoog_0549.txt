its existence in different objects.—Resisti posset. “ Resistance could
be made.''

 

CHAPTER V111.

1-13. Repens. See previous chapter, line 19.—Duoere . . . oeetimare.
Historic infinitiveS. ÷Quamvis Ievis causa. “A sickness however
slight.’'—Quam valido. For quam in valido. The preposition is gen-
erally, in Cicero always, repeated after disjunctive conjunctions.—‚
Inciderit. The future perfect from the speaker's point of view.
Madvig reads incideret—Non rerum, etc. “ Not by the magnitude of
the events, but by the weakness of its powers.”-—Ma9nitudine. The

ablative of measure. The preposition ex and ab are generally used
in the earlier writers· ι

16-25. Dictaturam dicendum. “ To the appointment of a dictator. ”
Preposition ad is omitted. A dictator was appointed, on the order
of the Senate or people‚ by one of the consuls3 and during his con-
tinuance in office, other magian-acies, except the tribuneship of the
people‚ were subordinate to him, and the consuls were not allowed to
display any ensigns of authority before him. As the office was held
for six monthS, and as Fabius laid it down in autumn, this creation
must have been made in April. The battle at Lake Trasimene must,
therefore, have been fought in early spring, although, from the con-
fusion in the Roman calendar, Ovid, in his Fasti, gives as the date
the 23d of June. M. Minucius had been consul four years before he
became maqister equitum—Dimicandum esse. Infinitive in oratio obli-
qua, after a word of saying implied in neqotium dat.

ponent, FlaminiuS‚ during his censorship, and followed it through Um-
bria.—-Perpopulato. Perfect participle in a passive sense—Moles.
“The size and strength, and the difficulty of sturming the city.’'-
Romanae urbis. Emphatic position—Copia . . . proeda. The former
is “provisions ;” the latter, “ plunder to be carried off.”

10-19. Aliquot dies. This time was occupied in aiming the troops
in Roman fashion.-Hibernis itineribus, etc. Ablatives after adflatus.

-Ad eventum. “With reference to the event.”—Levi. “With light
loss.’'—h'acili. ‘⁴ With small exertion.''-—-Satis quieti datum. “ When
he had satisfied the longing for repose of soldiers who delighted in,'’ etc.
claudentibus sc. militibus may either be a second dative after datum,
