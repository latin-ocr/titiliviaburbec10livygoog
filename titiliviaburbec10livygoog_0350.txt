conve. That is, “from those tablets, whether plain or covered with
wax.” Before copper οι· bronze was used for the purpose, lawe and
treaties were either carved on wood or written on waxed tabletS.
The treaty between Rome and Gabii was marked on a wooden shield,
preserved in the temple of Jupiter Fidius, in the former city. (Dionys, ‚
ir„ say—Dok) malo. This is not a pleonasm. The term dolus orig-
inally meant ‘⁴ a device, '’ and hence in the earlier and especially ju-
ridical language, when connected with malus, it became a common ex-
pression for “ deception,” “ guile‚'’ or “ fraud.” On the other hand,
the ancients also employed dolus bonus in an opposite sense. Com-

33—37. Defexit. Old form for defecerit—Publice consilio, etc.
“ Fraudulently‚ by public concert.’'— Tum aaa die, Jupiter. The true
lection here is uncertain. Sigonius and others give on conjecture,
tum tu, ille Diespiter. We have preferred retaining the common read-
ing with Drakenborch—May& potes pellesque. “ Thou art more
able and powerful.'' Possum refers here to ability to act3 polleo to
the possession of abundant means for acting. Compare Doederlein,
Synonym„ s. v, possse,- Habicht‚ p. 387.—Saxo silice. ‘⁴ With a flint-
stone.’' Silice has here the force of an adjective.

5-10. Feroces et suopte ιἠρεηὶο, etc. [“ Courageons both from their
own natural disposition, and because they were animated by the eries
of their exhorting countrymen. ”]—Quippe imperium ayebatur. “For
supremacy was at stake.” More literally, “ was the point in litiga—
tion.''—Itaque eryo. “ And thus then.'' Itaque (et ita) preserves
the connection; and erqo is brought in to strengthen itaque—Minime
yratum spectaculum. This was far from being a. show calculated to
amuse, such as a combat of gladiators, or the like.

12—18. Velut ades. “Like armies in battle array.'’—Terni juve-
nes. “The three youths on each side.’' ‘Observe the force of the ”
distributive numeral. —Futuraque ea deinde, etc. “And the fortune
of their country, destined to be such as they themselves should have
made it. ” Ea with the force of talia—Ut primo statim. There was
no prolusio, as in gladiatorial conflictS, but an earnest combat com-
menced immediately.—Horror inqens. “A deep shudde1·.”—Tovpe-
bat. “Were each suspended.”

19—28. Ayitatioque αηοερε, etc. “And the rapid movement on
both sides of weapons and arms‚’' i. e.‚ of arms offensive and defen-
sive. On the force of anceps here, compare Klotz, vol. i.‚ p. 390.—
