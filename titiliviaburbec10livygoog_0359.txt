attended the annual festival of the goddess, not only sor religious
objects‚ but as a kind of fair for the purposes of trade, a custom which
seems to have prevailed at all similar meetingS.-Mercatu fi·equenti.
“ In a crowded market.''-In lucum confuqisse. “ Had fied for refuge
into the grove (of the asylum).” Compare chap. viii. These were
offenders against justice, whom the Romans had refused to deliver up.
[Madvig suggests that servos has dropped out before suos, and intro-
duces it into his text3 but Dionysius describes those who took refuge
as φυγάδας, “ exiles, '’ and says that slaves were not received into the
asylum]

19-27. Haudparam memores. ‘⁴ Remembering well.”-- OErcumspioere
et ipsi, etc. That is, as the Romans had been strengthened by the
forces of Tatius and the accession of the Albana, they too looked about
for foreign aim—Residuas bellorum iras. ‘⁶ The angry feelings still
remaining from former war3.”-—Et apud vayos quosdam, etc. “ And
with some stragglers also from the indigent populace pay had its
weight.’' The voluntarii were from the upper classes of the Veientes,
the vayi from the rabble of the city.--Publico auxilio, Assistance
from the government of Veii. -Nam de ceteris minus mirum est. That
is, it is less surprising that the rest of the Etruriam, who had no
quarrel with the Romana, did not aid the &hines—Pacta cum Romulo
indutiarum fides. It is probable that on this occasion the truce was
renewed by Tullus.

28-34. Vera· in eo. “To turn on thiS.”——Oocupat transire. “Is
the first to pass over.'’ Consult note on 'chap. xiv„ line 15.-Ad
silvam Malitiosam. “ At the forest called Malitiosa.” Compare
Dionysius (iii., 33): τὴν ὕλην καλουμένην κακοῦργον. This forest lay
in the Sabine territory, and received its name probably from its being
infested by robbers—Ubi et peditum, etc. “ Where by the strength
also of the infantry, it must be allowed, but (especially) by their re-
cently augmented cavalry, the Roman army proved far superior.'’
Ceterum for sed is frequently used in prose, as Zumpt remarks (ἓ 349),
after Cicero’s tima—Constare. “ Be maintained.’'—Nec fuya explica-
ri. ‘⁴ Nor could ssight be made.'' Explicare here properly meam, “to
bring into definite shape or coriditionss' a signification arising from
the litei-al 'one “to unfold.'’ Compare Scheller’s explanation of the
present clause: “ die Flucht konnte nicht zu Stande qebraclzt werden.'’

4-16. Lapidibns pluisse. “ That it had rained stones.” Literally,
‘⁴ with stones.” 1 'luo takes also the accusative. Thus, “ sanquinem
pluisse senatui nuntiatum est.’' (Cie.,Div.‚ii.‚27.)—In conspectu. “In
