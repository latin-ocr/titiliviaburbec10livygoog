CHAPTER XXXI.

8-11. Exuitque. The que connects extat aa e consequence with
suad-'t fingatque. The ordinary reading is ct enda—Qua, dum se
cornua, etc. “ In the part where, while the wings extend themselves
too widely, they had not properly strengthened their line by a depth
of files‚” i. e., by deepening the tiles· Literally, “ by files inward.”
Some read quam, and reject the second adem, from ει dislike of the
repetition of the seme word. But Livy shows numerous instancoe
of similar repetitione—Meamne est. “ And the wer was end-
ed‚” i. e., by the subjugation of the enemy, for the word does not
mean ιο put an end ιο a war in any way, as, for instance, by peace.—
Locus in circo, etc. Thet is, a place where he might ercet a. seat,
whence to view the gemes. Compare bk. i., chap. xxxv„ line 33.

14-23. Et cohm’a deducta. “ And a colony was planted. ” Liter-
ally, ‘⁶ was led forth. ”—Post aliquanto. “ Some time after.”—— Crimi-
nantes. “ Compluining.”—Irrita caderent. ‘⁴ Might fan to the ground
of no effect,'’-Petpulere, nt forte temere, etc. “ Forced him at all
hazan-ds to march his army up the opposite mountain8.” Compare
note on bk. i., chep. xxvii„ line 23.--Id ma'le conmissum. “ This
imprudent step. ”— obstupefacti. ‘⁴ Astonnded.”—In aversas valles.
“ Into the valleys in their rear. ” Literally, “Into the valleys that
were turned away-'⁹ The from of the camp was towards the Romane,
and the valleys were in a direction opposite to this. Some read adver-
sas, on the principle that the valleys were aversoe while they continued
in their cemp3 but when they left their camp, and turned their backs
to the Romans, the valleys, which had been aversoe to them, then be-
came adversoe. This, however, is rather far-fetched.

26-31. Tanta cum qratia, etc. “With so much influence as well
as artifice had the money-lenders concelted mensuret, to disappoint,”
ete—Omnium actionum in senatu, etc. “ Of all his mensures in the
Senate made thet in favor of the victorious people the first3 and pro-
posed the question, what it was their pleasure should be done in the
case of those confined for debt.’' Any act or measure of a magistrate
before the Senete or people was called actia—Relatio. “ Metion.”

32-42. Me dius fidius. “ Depend upon it.” Fid-'m is a surname
of Jupiter as the god of saith (Ζεὺς nim-109), and the full expression
W0¹¹¹d be, “ mc dius (i. e.‚ deus) fidius servet.” Hence it means,
‘⁴ most assuredly,'’ “ most certainly,'’ “ depend upon it,'‘ etc. Zumpt,
