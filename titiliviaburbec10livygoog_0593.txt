mr. xxn„ cnsp· Lx. 583

xxi„ chap. x., line 8, ‘⁸ monuisse praedsxzsseP—Pervmire posse. In-
finitive after word of saying implied in adhortari.

39-44. P. Decius. The story is told in bk. vii„ cbap. xxxiv. He
volunteered to seize a hill iu front, and divert the attack of the
enemy till the army could escape. Cato tells the story, but calls the
tribune Q- Caedicius—Duceret. The potential of the past.—- Vos.
‘⁶ You, the captives.'’ Manlius speaks here as if they were before
him.

54-62. Domina& capite. The capitis daninutio maxima, which is
further described by the following words, abalienata· jare οόυἰιιηι, in-
volved loss of citizenship and freedom.——Non audistis, “You did
not listen t0.”—Quam syo ἰφιαυίαηι. The conduct which he stigma-
tizes as cowardice merely is rather tranem—conati sant. Here
nearly equivalent to the imperfect of endeavor. “ They were for
attempting.’'-—Strictt's yle-diis. Compare chap. 1., line 34.—Inerle3.
Accusative case.

67-75. Sexcentt'. The party from the smaller camp—Qus· auderent.
‘⁶ To dare.”-Duamm leyionum. A little over eight thousand men.
-Da'xerint. Supply se.--Nisi quis. “ Unless one can believe them
to have been loyal who,'’ etc—Aut non invidere. The idea iS, they
showed themselves devoid of all soldier—like loyalty when they op-
posed' their comi-adem they will for the future exhibit the same
want of loyalty from envy and shame.

80-91. Ad mmpendum. From these words down to victi sunt Man-
lius is evidently giving some supposed reply of a defendet· of the
prisonem and their conduct3 Weissenborn, therefore, after Wex, in·-
serts in his text before ad the words At etnim, the usual formula with
which a speaker introduces the supposed arguments of an opponent.
-Vallum armis. The latter word is a conjecture of Gronovius for
the manuscript reading ama. If we retain arma, then obsessi is for
obsessi sune, and we must supply tutata sunt with annm—Se ipsi.
See Zumpt, ,ξ 696.-—Orto sole. This is the rebutter to the supposed
reply. -Voln‘s. Ethical dative—Decuma. Compare chap. xxii.²
line 62.—Et vos redimam. A rhetorical question implying a negative
opinion on the part of the speaker.—Compare the speech here assigned
to Manlius with Horace, iii., ode ὅ, 12. The similarity is too great to
be accidental, and Livy's display of rhetoric, like Horace's ode, may
have been intended to influence opinion about the recovery of the
soldiers of Crassus and Antony, who had been so long the prisoners
of the Parthians. If this supposition is well founded, the date of
this book cannot be later than B. C. 20, when the prisoners were re-
stored.
