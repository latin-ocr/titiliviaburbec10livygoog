nobilitas tua. An allusion to the Roman Jus imaqz‘nwn.——Domus reyt'a.
Of Tarquiniae, not of Servius—Crem vocatque reyem. The verb, con-
trary to the grammatical rule, sometimes agrees with the nearest of
several nonna, as the on'e which is generally intended to be most
emphatic. (Zumpt, ᾗ 370, 'note.)-—Quid frustraris? ‘⁴ Why dost
thou disappoint ?”--Reqium. “ of regal spirit. '’—Facesse. ‘A‘ Betake
thyself.”—-Devoloere retro ad stirpem. “ Sink back to thy (original)
stock.’' Literally, “Be rolled down back,’' etc. A contemptuovis
allusion to one wh0, while seeking to scale the heights of greatneSS,
loses his foothold through indecisiou aud want of energy, and tum-
bles backward to his startiug-point.

20-23. Instiyat. “ She stimulateS.” — Si, cum Tanaquil, etc.
“(Thinking it disgraceful) if, when Tanaquil,’' etc. We must men-
tally supply turpe existimans, or something equivalent, before si.—
Nullum momentum faceret. “ Could¹ exercise no influence.'' Momen-
tum properly denotes a balant-ing or oscillating motion, and then a
particle sufficient to turn the balanced scalea, from which last arises
the figurative meaning of weight, influence, etc.

24, 25. His muliebribus instinctus furiis. “ Goaded on by these
maddening suggestions of the woman.'’ —Prensare. “ Solicited.’'
The term literally refers to the grasping of another-’s hand in solicit-
ing a faron—Mineruam yentium patres. They were indebted to his
father for their elevation, and ought therefore to be more anxious to
support him. The Patres minorum qentt‘um were, as already remarked,
‘⁶ the fathers of the younger houseS,'’ and the patres majorum qentium,
on the other hand, were those whose fathers were patricians under
Romulus and Tatius, Compare chap. xxxw, line 27.

26—34. Gratiam repetere. “-Begged a favor in returnJs— Cum de
se inqentia, etc. “lle grew into popula-rity in all quarters, both by
making magnificent promises on his own part, and especially by his ’
accusatione against the king.'’——Pro curia. ‘⁶ In the front part of the
Senate-house.’' Not in front of the senate-house, but in the building
itself. Compare pro rostris, pro tribunali, etc. The building here
meant was the Curia Hostilia, erected by Tullus Hostiliu3.--Ne non
- venisse fraudi esset. “Lest it might prove detrimental to them not
to have come.” Fraus is here employed, as often in Livy, in its old
legal sense of harm or injury. Compare chap. xxiw, line 23.—Et
jam de Servio actum rati. “ And thinking now that all was orer with
ServiuS.” This phraseology appears to have a legal origin. As a
snit once decided could not be recommenced, there arose the phrase,
actum est de me, etc„ ‘⁶ It is all over with me,” ‘⁶ I am undone.’'

35-43. Ab stirpe ultim. “From the first origin (of Servius). ’'—
