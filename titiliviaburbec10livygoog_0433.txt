they came onward with hostile speum, that the arm⁴ of AEbutius was
pierced through, the breast of Mamilius was wounded.’' Literally‚
‘⁸ Was struck.” This does not, of course, imply that it was pierced
through like the arm of his opponent, but the idea of wounding is
merely a general oue—Proelium ciet. “ Stirs up the fight.”--Ea. Scil.

Roman general appears to have been attended by a select troop as his
body-guard. At a later period Scipio Africanus formed a regular co-
hort for this purpose, tei-med cohors praeton'a, out of the brevest troops,
whom he exempted from all other duties except guarding his person,
and to whom he gave sixfold pay. At a still later day the praetorian
cohorte became a separate force owing to the policy of Augustus, and
played an important part in the history of the empire. ——Dat siquam.
