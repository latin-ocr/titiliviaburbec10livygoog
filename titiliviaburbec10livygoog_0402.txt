-Delplaoa Delphi, the celebrated oraclo of Apollo, was situated on
the side of Mount Parnassus, in Phocis. The Romans very seldom
consulted this oncle, prefert-ing their own haruspicem—Sortem. By
sortes are meant properly anything used to determine chauces, such
as small tablets, lots, etc„ and hence the term is often employed, as
in the present instance, to indicate the oracle melfi—Per {quotae ea
tempestate terras. etc. Livy’s language is too strong. The route to
Greece could not have been so unknown to the communities of Cen-
tral Italy as he makes it, since Caere had relations with Delphi, Tar-
quinii with Corinth, and Rome with Cumae in Magna Graecia.

26-32. Tarquinia sorore reyis natus. Dionysius says that Tarquinia
was the aunt of Tarquiniae, having been the sister of his mother, and
the daughter of Tarquinius Priscus.-Juvenis Ionye alius inqenio, etc.
“A youth far different in cast of mind from that which he had as-
sumed the disguise of.” We must employ the term ⁴⁶ youth'’ here in
what may be tei-med its Roman sense, since the term juvenis was ap-
plied from the nge of 25 to 45, when military service ceased. Brutus
at this time had two sons in early manhood.-In quibus. Equir-
alent to et in iis.—Interfictmn. Agreeing with the last-mentioned
subject, fintrem. It should properly have been interfectos, with a
comma after suarm—Neque in animo suo, etc. “Resolved that noth-
ing should either be feared by the king from his qualities of mind, or·
desired by him from his fortunes.”—Ubi injure, etc. ‘⁵ Where there
was little protection in justice. ’'

32-36. Factus. “ Haw‘ng moulded his deportment.'' Taken in a
middle sense.—-—Bruti quoque haud abnuit coynomen. The surname of
Brutus, according to the legend which Livy here follows, was given to
L. J unius because he pretended idiocy in order to save himself from
'sau-quin, and the word is accordingly supposed to siguify an “idiot.”
Dionysius, for instance, translates it by ἠλίθιος (ix-2, 67). Festus,
however, in a passage (s. v. Brutum) which is pointed ont by Arnold
(R. Η., vol. i., p. 104), tells us that Brutus, in old Latin, was synony-
mous with Gravis, which, as Arnold remei-ke, would show a connec-
tion with βάρυς. The word may, therefore, as a surname‚ have been
originally much the same as Severus. This conjecture seems more
probable than that of Niebuhr’S‚ who supposes it to mean a “runaway
slave,'’ and connects it with the Brettii, “revolted slaveS‚'‘ whence
the Bruttii are supposed to have derived their name. He farther
observes that this name might easily have been applied by the Tar-
quins to Brutus as a term of reproach. (Smith, Dict. Bioqr„ s. v.)-
opperiretur tempora sua. ‘⁶ Might wait for its proper opportunity. ”

37-42. Ludibrium. ‘⁴ As an object of sport.’'—Aureum baculum‚etc.
‘⁶ Α golden rod, enclosed in a staff of cornel-wood hollowed out for
