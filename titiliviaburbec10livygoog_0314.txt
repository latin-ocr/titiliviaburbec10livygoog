was the highest and central summit of a remarkable group of mount-
ains in Latium, which form one of the most important physical feat-
ures of that country—In dorso. “ Along a ridge.'' This ridge ran
out from the foot of Mons Albanus, and extended along the eastern
shore of the Lacus Albanus to its north-eastern extremity‚ nearly
opposite the modern village of Mariua—Inter Lavinium, etc. ‘⁴ Be-
tween the founding of Lavinium and the leading forth of the colony
to Alba Longa nearly thirty years intervened.'‘. A substantive is
sometimes used with the perfect participle in such a way that we have
to think not so much of the thing itself in a certain state, as of the
action performed on the subject considered in itsels substantively.
(Madvig, ᾗ 426.)

19-22. Morte ΛΞΜ. “On the death of AEnea5.” Some wordS,
which do not in themselves denote time, but an event, are used in the
ablative without a preposition‚ in order to intimate the time when a
thing takes place. (Madvig, ξ 276, 2)-Αωί sint. The sequence of
tenses here would strictly require auderent ‚- but ausi sint is purposely
employed, from the idea of continuance which it carries with it, to
indicate that hostilities were not attempted against the Latius during
any portion of the time alluded to. [Kiihnast explains this use of
the subjunctive perfect as rnarking that a past occurrence is looked
at from the point of view of the present.]

23-27. Albula. It was a tradition generally received among the
Romans that the Tiber had been originally called Albula, and that it
changed its name in consequence of Tiberiane, one of the fabulous
kings of Alba, having been drowned in its wetere. Menneu, however,
considers Albula the Latin, and Tiberis the Etruscan name of the
stream. —St'lvius deinde reynat. There can be no doubt, as Niebuhr
remarks (vol. i.‚ p. 205), that the series of Alban kings, as given here
by Livy, and differently elsewhere by other writerS, is a clumsy for-
gery of a lue period3 but it may probably be admitted as historical
that a Silvian house or gens was the reigning family at Alba.—C'olo-
nioe aliquot. According to some eighteen, according to others thirty
in nummu—Prisci Latini aygpellatt'. “ Called ancient Latius.”
Appellati is by synizesis for appellatae. Some regard Prisci not as an

, attributive adjective, but as the name of a people (compare Os-ci,

Vols-ci, etc.), connected asyndetically with Latini, like patres oon-

scripti.—Goynoinm. Put for nomen, since all these kings belonged to
the qens Silvia.

30-40. Celebre ad posteros. “ Celebrated down to posterity‚” i. e.‚
down to the latest agea—Per manus. “ By immediate succession.'’

Compare the English expression, “from hand to hand.'’— Goqnomen
00Πὶ sed& A second instance of coquomen for nomem—Qui stirpis
