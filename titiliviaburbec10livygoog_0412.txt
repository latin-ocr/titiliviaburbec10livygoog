408 noras,

adjectivo, vicibus being understood—Privato. “ When a private in-
dividuul,'’ i. e.‚ after the expiration of his year of offla—Lavinium.
Consult note on bk. i.‚ chup. i.‚ line 41.—Cem·t. Plutarch, in his lise
of Poplicola, says that he was not compelled to leave Rome until he
attempted to savo hin nephewa tho Aquilii. And it is also stated that
he obtained twenty talenta out of the public treasury, and· five from
Bruma, out of his own property, aa a compensation.—Adpopulunu ta-
lit. “ Proposed to the poople‚” i. e.‚ brought in a bill to that effect.
This he did as presiding offieer at the comitia. So in tho next clause,

CHAPTER 111.

2-17. Spe omnium serius ficit. ‘⁴ ‘Vns later (in its breaking out)
than all expected. ”-Nec la· tenui loco orti. “ And these, too, not
sprung from a lowly origin.'’—-Quorum in reque, ete. ‘⁶ whose pas-
sions had been less restrained during the king'a reign, the equale in
age and boon companions of the young Tarquinii.”—AEqaatojure om-
nium. “Now that the rights of all were equalized.”—In suam ver.
iisse sev-vitutem. ‘⁶ llud turned into their alavery‚'' i. e.‚ had become
slavery for them. Venisse is only apparently intransitive here, se
being in reality understood—Revera hominem esse, ete. There is a
for-cible opposition here between hominem and loyes, as implied by the
words rem rur-dam. A king is bnt a man, aud a man may be swayed
by favor or kindness; but not so the lawe, which are deaf to expos-
matina—Ubi jus, ubi injuria opus sit. “Where right, where wrong
may be required,‘' i. e.‚ whether your request be a fair or an un-
fair one—Locum. ‘⁴ Room.‘’-Inopi quam potenti. Livy osten uses
the singular to indicate a elasa—So& innocentia vivere. ‘⁶ To live

solely by one’s integrity,” i. e.‚ to have no security for life but innoeence. ζ

18-24. AEyrt’s. “ Being discontented.”-Superveniunt. ‘⁴ Come Ι
unexpectedly.’'—Bona tantum repetentes. Under the head of “ effects'' ³
are probably here included those of the different individuals who ἸΙ
either went or were driven forth along with the TarquinS.——Tenuit. 4¹
‘⁴ Continued.’' Taken intransitively.—Interim quati alia moliri. The Ι
ordinary text has aliz· alia moliri. This, however, would merely signi· Ι
fy that the ambassadors were planning different schemen. As, how· ἡ
ever, together with the application for the restitution of the property, ,Ι
they were privately plotting for the return ofothe TarquinS, and for*
this alone, it is evident that alii must be strichen out, and the clause
clam recuperandi requi consilia struere must be regarded as explanatory
of alia. The ambassadors were pursuing one course with the Senam,
and another with the young nobles.—Tamquam ad id, quod ayn· videba-
tur. ι “As if to promote tho business which seemed to be carrying]¹
on,'' ι. e.‚ the restoration of the king‘s property. f
