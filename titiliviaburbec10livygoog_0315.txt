maxinme erat. Observe the employment of maximus, although only
two are meant. —Reae Siloiae. 'she true form is Rea, not Rhea. Nie-
buhr remarks that Rhea is a corruption introduced by the editorS,
apparently from thinking of the goddess Rhea3 whereas Rea seems
to have signified nothing more than the culprit. He also calls atten-
tion to the remmk of Perizonius, that when the mother of Romulus
is represented as the daughter of AEneaS, she is always called Ilia,
and that Rea is never prefixed to the latter name (Hist. Rome, vol. i.,
p. 211).—C'um Vestalem eam loqisset. The king, as priest, makes the

selection.

CHAPTER IV.

1-6. Debebaturjatis. “Was a debt all along due >to the fates.”
Observe the force of th³e imperfect, as referring to the long train of
antecedent events connected with the founding of the city. This
founding was due to them; it was a debt that should be paid to them,
und therefore an event which no humanpower could diverte-Secun-
dum deorum opes, “ cht to the power of the gods.''—-Seu ita rata,
etc. ‘⁶ Whether she really thought so, or because a god was (in her
eyes) a more creditable cause (to allego) for her indiscretion. ’'r—In-
certoe. stirpis. “Of her illegitimate offspriug. ” Α euphemism.
Compare Ulpian. “Qui matre quidem (certa) pacre autem incerto nati
sunt, spurii appellantur?

10-12. Forte quadam dic-initus. “By some chance, which heaven
seemed actually to direct.” Gronovius compa-res this form of ex-
pression with the Greek θείᾳ τινὶ τύχη. —Effusus lenibus staqnis.
“Having ovet-flowed in stagnant pools.’' Observe that Tiberis egffu-
sus, etc„ forms in fact the subject and ground to poterat and dabat.—
Nec adiri usquam ad justi, etc. ‘⁶ Could neither be approached any-
where‚as far as the regular current of the river, ” i. e.‚ the regular bed
of the stream.—Posse quamvis Ianyuida, etc. “ Could be dgowned in
water however still.”

14, 15. Ficus-⁴3 Ruminalis. “The Ruminal fig-tree.” So called,

. according to Festus (p. 270), because beneath this tree the she-wolf

afforded her dug to Romulus and RemuS, the dug (mannua) being
called in early Latin rumis or ruma. (Compare Donaldson, Varron.‚
p. 61.) This wild fig-tree stood on a part of the Palatine hill called
Germalus, facing the Capitoline mount, and near the Lupercal. It
was still to be seen in Livy’s time, as appears from the words nunc
esa—Romularem vocatam ferunt. The annalista related that its ear-
lier name was Ronmlaris, i. 6., “the Romulean fig-tree,” but this
was merely an attempt on their part to explain the meaning of the
word.
