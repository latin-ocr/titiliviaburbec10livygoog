“Thau being indignant at their condition, ’‘ i. e.‚ at the treatment

CHAPTER XXXII.

4-6. Tamen quoniam, etc. ‘⁴ Yet, since they had swern to the words
of the consuls’ (dictation),” i. e.‚ had sworn to the oath administered
by the consuls, It appearS, remarks Zumpt, from Livy’s description.
that the dictator, by virtue of his unlimited power, had completed the
levy, but had made the troops swear obedience not ιο himself, bnt to
the consuls of the year. We must take it se, though it seems strange.
We read a little above, however, that the dictator had not, as usual,
named a maqister equitum, but had intrusted the command of two
armies to the consuls. It seems probable, therefore, that he was ap-
pointed solely for the purpose of holding the levy.—Per causam.
“ Under the pretext.”

10-16. Nullam scelere reliyionem exsolvi. “ That no religione ob—
ligation is dissolved by an act of criminality.” The more prosaic
phraseology would be nulla reliyione exsolvi, ‘⁴ that men are freed from
no religione obligation.” Compare Zumpt‚§ 60⁷, note—Sacrum mon-
tem. The mons sacer was a hill about three miles from Rome, across
the Ani0, and on the right of the Via Nomentana. It was so called
because the people‚ on their return to the city, consecrated an altar
there to Jupiter. (Fest.‚p.318.)—Ea ιᾓνςῑιιεηιίον,ΐοιηιιι est,etc. “This
tradition is more generally received than that of which Piso is the
author.'’ Yet Sallust adopts the account of Piso (Bell. ἄνφ, xxxi.),
and says that the people retired twice to the Aventine, at this time,
namely, and after the death of Vix-ginia. With regard to Piso the
Annalist, consult note on bk. ii., chap. lviii„ line 3.—-Qm’eti. “ Re-
maining quiet.'’-—Sumendo. The ablative of the gei-und has often a
meaning closely connected with that of the present participle—Per
aliquot dies, neque lacessiti, etc. It seems hardly correct to say that
during this period they did not attack others, for though they abstained
from offering any personal violence, yet they supported themselves
from the lands of the Claudian tribe, hostile to and bitterly hated by
the plebeians, and whose possessions lay in the immediate vicinity
of the sacred mount. Dionysius says that the secession lasted for
three months, from about the lst of September to the lst of Decem-
ber. -
