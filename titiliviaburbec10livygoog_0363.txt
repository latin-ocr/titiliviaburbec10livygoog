ΒΚ. 1., OHAP. xxxm. 359

60-70. Puberibus. ‘⁴ Grown-up persons, ‘’—Quod populi Pri-§comm
Latinorum, etc. “ Forasmuch as the states of the Prisci Latini and
the men of the Prisci Latini have acted, have offended against, etc.”
From the more general designation of populi he passes to the more
special one of homine-e.— Censuit, consensit, conscivit. “ Have given
their opinion, have consented, have voted in accordance.”·-Ob eam
rem. “'l'herefore.”—Id ubi dixisset. The subjunctive of repeated
action, for Livy is here describing what was the regular course of
proceeding whenever the Romans declared wan—Posteri acceperunt.
When the war with Pyrrhus broke out, the custom of hui-ling a spear

· within the confines-of the foe could not be observed in the usual man-

ner3 wherefore a captive soldier of Pyrrhus’s was made to buy a
piece of ground near the temple of Bellona, which symbolized the
territory of the enemy, and was called ayer hostilis. Into this the
spear was flung on this as well as on all subsequent occasione, when-
ενοι· war was to be declared against a people whose country lay be-
yond the sea. (Serv., ad AEn., ix., 53.)

 

CHAPTER XXXIII.

1-9. Sam-orum Those namely which appertained to-the regal of-
fica—Flamiuibus. Consult note on chap. xx., line 3.—Politorium.
'l‘he situation of this early city is quite uncertain. Gen places it at
La Giostra‚ on the right of the Via Appia, about ten miles from Rome.
—Ee cum circa Palatium, etc. “ And since the Sabines had filled the
Capitoline and citadel, the Albans the Caelian mount, around the Pal-
atine,” i. e.‚ places lying around the Palatina—Aventinum. This
neuter form for Aventinus (scil. mons) occurs again in the present
chapter, and also in iii., 67: “Adversus nos Aventinum capitur.'’
Dionysius frequently calls it τὸ Ἀβεντινόν.

10-16. Tellenis. Tellenae is said by Nibby to answer to the modern
La G't‘ostra‚ where Gell places the site of Politorium. The name of
this city appears again in Rc. 493, among the confederate cities of
the Latin magne—Ficana. This place was situated on the Via Os·—
tiensiS, eleven miles from Rome, and immediately adjoining the Tiber.
—Novi cives. In this way the plebeian order gradually arose, at first
under the control of a ruling dese, or aristocracy (the patricians), but
afterwards forming an integral portion of the state—Omni bello Latino
Medulliam eompuLso. “ The whole war having been concentrated at
Medullia. ” Literally, “having been driven together to Medullia*
Dionysius makes this place a colony of Alba. Its site is unknown.
—Marte incerto, varia victoria. ‘⁸ In doubtful conflict, with varied
success, '’ 'l'he two ideas are so intimately connected that there is no
need of any connecting conjunction.
