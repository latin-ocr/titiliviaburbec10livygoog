1-4. Quoe . . . absumi. “Ofsuch a natum asto aequit.” The
relative is equivalent here to tales ut, and hence is followed by the
subjunctive. Consult Zumpt, ξ 558.—Sed quoe adeo in contrarium ver-
terent, etc. ‘⁶ But such as to change the whole affair to so opposite a
character, that they even made him popular. ’' After nmen-ent supply
rem—Papularum. The term popularis, in its politica] sense, properly
means one who is attached or devoted to the people‚ as opposed to the
nobility. Hence the general signification of “popular.” So in the
plural, by populares are strictly meant the people‘s party, as opposed
to the optimates or aristocracy.-Coynomen Publicola The term
Publicola means literally, ‘⁴ one who courts the people '’ (from popalus
and colo), and thus, as here, “a friend of the people.” The form
Poplicula οι· Poplicola was the most ancient. Poplicola generally oc-

impunity.-— Ut sua unius in his qratia esset. “ That the popularity in
the case of these might be exclusively his own.” Observe that sua
unius is sor sus· unia-3, or, in other wordS‚ unius is put in apposition with
the personal pronoun implied in the possessive sua. (Zumpt, ἕ 424.)
—Oolleqoe subroyando. “For electing a new colleague.” The verb
subt-oyare means literally, ‘⁴ to choose in place of another.'' So here,
“to choose a colleague in place of B1·utus.”

11-21. Sp. Lucretius. The father of Lucretia, Sp. Lucretius Tricipi-
tinus. Compare bk. i., chap. lviii„ line 21, and chap. lx„ line 20.—
Bruto statim Horatium suqqerunt. They place Horatius immediately

after Brutus.” Polybius (iii.‚ 22) mentions Brutus and Horatius to-
gether as the first consula—Memoria intercidisse. “ That it has fallen

out of remembrance.'’ The idea literally conveyed by intercidere is,
