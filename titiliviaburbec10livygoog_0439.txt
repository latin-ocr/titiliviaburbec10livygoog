24-32. Contioni. “ Το his speech,” i. e., to what he had just said
in the contio or assembly.-Edixit. “ He ordained.’'—Quo minus εἰ,
etc. “So that he should not have the power,’' etc. -Morareturi
“ Detain in custody,’' i. e., as a pledge for his debt3 because a man's
children and grandchildren were by the law 'in a state of qnasi-slavery
to him, and, of course, considered as part of his property. [The pa-
tria potestas is distinguished from dominium over slaves (Diffi, 50, 16,
225), and never involved ownership3 yet both children and slaves
were res mancipi. See Smith's Dict„ s. v. patria potestas.]—Proposito.
‘⁶ Having been published.'’ -Νεωιὶ “ The debtors.” Those who
were indebted to others, and under obligations to pay, but not yet in
the immediate power of their creditore—Ut ἐασναηιεπτο dicerent. “To
take the military oath.” Ister-any, ‘4 To give their adhesion to the
oath.'’ Sam-amento is 'here the dative, not the ablative. After the
levy was completed, one soldier was chosen to repeat the words of the
military oath, and the rest swore after him, that is, each, one as he
passed along said idern in me.

2-14. So* qua, etc. ‘⁶ (To see) if any desertion or treachery might
be able to be effected during the night.”—Temptant. “ Make an at-
tempt upon.”— Vellebantur. ‘⁴ Were being torn up.” The reference
is particularly 'to the valli or stakes which held together the earth of
the rampart, and the pulling up of which would insure the demolition
of the wall—Fuyimto'bus. More graphio than fuyientium.

· 18-22. Suessam Pometiam. Livy describes here, the year and the
name of the foe being alone changed, the same event which he had
already related in chapter xvii. Dionysius mentions the occurrence
only under the present year.—Paulum recreatus. ‘⁶ Were a little re-
lieved.”—Eoetranorum Volscorum. “ Of the Volscian Ecetrani.” The
Ecetrani were the inhabitants of Ecetra, a. 'city of the Volscians‚ which
figures repeatedly in the wars of that people with the RomanS. It
was situated on the north-eastern frontier of the Volsci, towards the
AEqui and Mount Algidus, ⁴

CHAPTER XXVI.

1-10. Confestim et Sabini. “ Immediately after, the Sabines als0,”
i. e., as well as the Volsci—Tumultus. ‘⁴ A turbulent inroad.'’ This
term was osten, as here, taken in a loose and general sense to signify
any sudden and disorderly taking up of arms, In a special sense,
however, it meant a sudden or dangerous war in Italy or Cisalpine
