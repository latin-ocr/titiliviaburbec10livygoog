1-7. Libera· jam hinc populi Romani, etc. “ Ι shall now go through
with the transactions in peace and in war of the Roman people from
henceforth free, their annual magistrateS, and the commands of the
laws more powerful than those of men.'’ Imperium properly means
military power or command; here, however, it has a more general
reference to the sovereignty or absolute sway of the laws in all cases,

⁸ whether military or einh—Hominum. The preceding kings are meant.

—Proximol A”much more natural reading than proxima, as given in
some manuscripts and editions—Conditor& partium certe urbis. “As
founders of parts at least of the city.’' Certe implies that though they
were not entitled to be counted as founders of the whole city, still
they ought to be regarded as founders of parts of it at least. In the
case of Numa, it is true, there was no outward enlargement of- the
city, but still, as Livy himself elsewhere remarks (i., 19), he may be
said to have founded it anew by laws and institutions.—Novas sedes.
- ‘⁶ As new settlements.”

10-19. Pessime publico 501 facturus suerit. “Would have done so
, with very great injury to the state.'' More liternlly‚ “ With the worst
public effect. '' Compare the ordinary forms of expression, bovium pub-
,⁶ Iicmu, malum publicum, etc. Observe moreover thatsactums fuerit, be·
ing in a hypothetical sentence, has instead of its own meaning as a
perfect that of a pluperfect. (Zumpt, δ 498.)-—Immatwrae. Another
reading is immatura—Quid enim futurum fuit. “For what would
have been the result ?‘’ Perfect again employed in a hypothetica}
sentence, with the force of a pluperfect. —Illa plebs. ‘⁴ That rabble.”
—'-Sub tuteh inviolati templi. “ Under the protection of an inviolable
asylum.” The reference here is literally to the temple which Rom-
ulus erected in connection with, and for the purpose of giving a sa·
cred character ιο, his asylum.—-Liber!atem. Exemption from previ-
ous control or bondage.—Om' brayo tempore adsumitur. “ To which
men become familiarized only by length of time. '' Observe that ‹id-⁸
nescitur, as an impersonal verb, is quite ummah—Animos eorum con-
sociasset. “ Had united their minds (in one society),'' i. e., had pro-
duced unity of social feeling in their bosoms.

20-27. Res nondum adultae. “ Their affairs not yet matured.” Lit-
cruny, “Not yet grown to maturity.’'-—Quas fovit tranquilla, etc.
“ Which the tranquil moderatiou of the kingly rule had nurtured.''
The mild mle of the early kings, up to the period of the last Tarquin,
served as a school for foster-ing the germ of future freedom.—Inde nu·
