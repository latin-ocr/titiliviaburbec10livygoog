CHAPTER XXXVII.

4-13. Maynam vim liquor-mn. Dionysius (iit, 56) says dry wood
and &gnte (ξύλων αὔων καὶ effraenae-Et, pleraque, in ratibus, etc.
“And when most of it (being placed) 'on flotus, having been driven
against, kept sticking amid the pilos, they set the bridge on fire.''
'lhis agrees with the account given by Dionysius, who speaks of boats
and floats (σκάφας καὶ σχεδίας) employed on the occasion. Some edi-
tors less correctly punctuate as follows, in ratibusn ἠφασεα sabbis,
cum ἥατο-αα, making ratibus refer either to the timbers of the bridge,
or to boats which formed the body of the structure, and connecting
the term in construction with ltaererent. The bridge meent is the one
built by the Sabines at the confluence of the Anio and 'siben—Et
fusis. A better reading than fitutia—Ad urbem coquito. “Being
recognized at the city. '’-Insiqnem “ Pluinly known. ”

18-26. Petebant. The imperfect here denotes the stt-iring to at-
tain an object.—- Tenum-e. ‘⁴ Reached them. ”— Vulcano. Tarquinius
had vowed that he would burn the spoils taken from the enemy in
honor of this deity, becauoe it had been through his agency that· the
bridge had been consumed and the victory thus won. — Gestms.
Along with the personal pronoun (se) the copula is commonly omitted
with the infinitive future—Tumultuario milite. “ With a hastily
levied soldiery.” Soldiers were called tumultuarii, when there was no
time to enlist them in the regular way, in consequence of the urgent
state of affairs. —Perditis jam prope rebus. “ Their affairs having
now become almost ruined.'’

 

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

1-3. Colbztia. An ancient city of Latium, about ten miles east of
Rome, between Gabii and the Anio. virgil notices it as one of the
colonies of Alba (AEn.‚ vi„ 7 74); a clear proof that he regarded it as
a Latin town3 and Dionysius also distinctly attributes it to that peo-
ple. It is strange, therefore, that Livy speaks of it here as if it had
been a Sabine city previous to its conquest by the Romans, —Eyeriua
He obtained in consequence of this the surname of CollatinuS‚ which
he transmitted to his descendants3 and Lucius TarquiniuS, the hus-
band of Lucretia, is represented as residing at Collatia at the time

of the siege of Ardea. (Dionys., iv.‚ 64.)—In proesidio. ‘⁴ Over the
garrnson.” ,

6-13. Oratores. “Deputiesss’ — Estne populus Collatinus in sua
potestate? “Are the people of Collatia under their own control?”
i e. ‚are they independent, and able to act for themselves?—- Utensilia
