BR. 1., OHAP. xxlv. 345

15, 16. Tum. “ On this occasion.''—Fetialis. “A Fetial.'' The
Fetiales were a college of Roman priests, who acted as the guardians
of the public saith. It was their province, where any dispute arose

with a foreign state, to demand satisfaction‚ to determine the circum· -

stances under which hostilities might be commenced, to perform the
various religione rites attendant on the solemn declaration of war,
and to preside at the formal ratification of peace. Their services
were-considered absolutely essential in concluding a treaty. The
etymology of the name is uncertain3 the less correct orthography is
fecialis.

17, 18. Cum patre patrato, “With the pater patratuS.’' Usually,
four of the college of fetiales were deputed to act when a treaty was
to be ratified, and these again elected one of'their number to be their
representative. This individual was styled pater patratus, that ie,
the “father'' charged with the duty of “completing” (patrare) the
busineSS. A fillet of white wo< l was bound around his head, together
with a wreath of sacred herbs (saymina) gathered from within the
enclosure of the Capitoline hill. We have here mention made of a
similar, official on the part of the AlbanS.—Sa9mina. “ Vervain.''
We have here given-the customary translation of the term. Strictly
speaking, however, it ought to be rendered “ sacred herbS,'' the ver-
vain being merely one of the number. So again verbenae, which were
the same as saymina, properly means sacred boughS‚ that is, of laurel,
olive, myrtle, etc.

19-28. Puram tollito. “ Take up a pure plant. '’ Supply herbam.—
G'ramim's herbam puram. “ A pure grass-herb.”-—- Vasa, comitesque
ineos? “Do you, my implements and attendants ?” i. e., do you in-
clude these also in my sacred commission and privileges?—Sine
*fi-aude mea. “Without any detriment to myself.’' Fraus is here
used in its strictly legal sense of injury produced by deception of any
kind—Pater patratus ad jusjurandum, etc. “ The pater patratus is
created for perfecting the oath.'’ Compare note on line 17.—Lon90

·‹;ffata carmine. ‘⁴ Uttered in along set form.'’ Carmen often occurs
in the sense of a formula in religion or law, since these were anciently
written iu verse.-—Non operoe est. “It is not worth while.” We
may supply pretium, though no ellipsis is in reality necessary.

30, 31. Populus Albanus. The nominative sor the vocative, for the
purpose of emphasis, in imitation of the Greek. This, however, is
properly a poetic usage. (Zumpt, ἓ 492, ηοιε.)-Πτ illa palam, etc.
“ As those conditions have been recited publicly, first and last, from
those tablets or from waX, without any deception, and as they have
been here this day understood in their most obvious sense, from those
conditione the Roman people will not be the first to swerve. ''— Tabulis
