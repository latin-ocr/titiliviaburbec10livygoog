the Lycean Pan.

‚line 20.—Ob iram praedoe amissos. “ Through anger on account of the

—Eodem pervenit. ‘⁴ He came to the same conclusion (as before)‚”
i. e., to the same conclusion which he‘had formed from a comparison
of their age and spiri t.—Ut haud procul esset, etc. [Like mimimo ab·

the king.” Ad here properly denotes that he makes his way to the
king through the midst of those who happened to be around him or
‚in his palace at the time, and then attacks him.
