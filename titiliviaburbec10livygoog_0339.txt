18-26. opes. “The balance of power.”—Ad unum. “ To a man.''
—Accitua “When sent for. '⁹ More literally, “When called unto
them.” From accio, not from aecieo, which would give accitus, and in
a different sense—Aufinum urbe condenda, etc. “When the city
was about to be founded, had obtained the kingdom by augury.”—
IIonoris eryo. “ For the sake of honor.’' Eryo (originally ἔργῳ) is
used in antiquated style, with the genitive, with the force of cau-se,
and is put after its case. (Madvig, ἓ 172, obs. 5.)—Arcem. The posi-
tion of the Arx has given rise to great controversy among antiquarianS.
Becker places it on the north-eastern summit of the Capitoline hill,
but it is more correct to make it to have stood on the south-western
summit. Consult on this subject the remarks of Dyer, in Smith’s
Die-c. Geoq„ vol. ii.‚ p. 767.—In lapide. This stone was in a part of
the Arx called Auyuraculum, so denominated because it had been
consecrated once for all for the purpose of taking auguries.-·Ad
meridiem. 'l‘hat is, in the direction ·iu which the gods were supposed
to look forth from their abode in the north. [Versus. This seems to

quarter.—C'‹zpite velato. The augur on all such occasions wore a vess,
the reason of which custom may be seen in Virgil, AEn., iii., 405.
This covering of the visage, however, was of course not so thick as
completely to obstruet the view, Some editors, mistaking the mean-
ing of the passage, remove the comma after ejus, and place it before
the pronoun‚ thus connecting ejus with capite velato, and making the
words refer to Numa. Compare chapter xxxvi„ “ Statua Atti, capite
velato.”—Prospectu in urbem, etc. ‘⁶ Having taken a view in the di-

29-31. Reqiones ab oriente, etc. The heavens, according to the
Roman ritual‚ were divided into four regionS, by two lines intersecting
oue another in a point over the augur's head, one called the limes de-
cimanus, the more important one, from east to west3 and the other,
termed cardo, from north to south. The latter of these, as being of
less importunes, Livy has omitted to mention.—Dextras ad meridiem
