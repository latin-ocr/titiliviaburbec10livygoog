4:22 nors-s.

Livy very carelessly mixes up here the two accounts of the termina-
tion of this war, the one dictated by Roman vanity, which made Por-
sena to have been foiled of his object, and the other, or true one,
which made Rome to hare been actually conquered by the Etrurian

monarch. Consult note at the close of the present chapter.

17-21. Adpubb’ca deeora. ‘⁶ To public acts of glory‚'' i. e., to eam
distinction by patriotic apione—Ripa Tiberis. A different localsty,

of course, from that mentioned at the beginning of chapter xi„ since
Porsena had now retired from the Roman territory—Ad propinquos
restituit. Another tradition, of far less celebrity than the one here
followed by Livy, made all the hostages to have been massacred by
Tarquinius, with the exception of Valeria, who swam over the 'liber
and escaped to Rom03 and the equestrian statue, mentioned belong
to have been erected to her, and not to Cloelia. (Diony-³„ ι, 33. Com·
pare Plut., Poplic„ 19.)

22-30. Oratores. Poetic for leyatos. —Alias haud maym‘ ,Γαῖα-ε,
“ That he did not make the other hostages of any great consequence. ”
—Supra Coclites Muciosque. In comparisons of this kind the person
is often mentioned instead of the act or quality by which he is made
conspicuous. —Proe referre. “ Openly declared.”—- Utrimque constitit
fides. “Good saith stood firm on both sides,” i. e., maintained its
ground.-Laudatam. “ After having been eulogized by him.”-—Parte.
“ With half.” Supply dimidia.

32-34. Quod et viryinitati decorum, etc. “What was both honor.
able to her virgin deliczmy, and was sure to be approved of by the
agreement of the hostages themselves, ’' etc—opportuna. ‘⁴ Exposed. ”

The tale which Livy follows in the present chapter, respecting the
conclusion of the war with Porsena, was that by which Roman vanity
concealed one of the earliest and greatest disasters of the city. The
real fact is that Rome was completely conquered by Porsena. This
‘is expressly stated by Tacitus (Hist, iii„ 7 2), and is confirmed by oth·-
er writers. Thus Dionysius relates (vx, 34) that the Senate sent Por-
sena an ivory throne, a sceptre, a golden crown, and a triumphal robe,
which implies that they did homage to him as their sovereign lord3
for we find that the Etrurian cities are represented to have sent the
same honors to the Roman king Tarquinius Priscus as an acknowl-
edgment of his supremacy. (Dionys, iii.‚ 62.) So thorough, indeed,
was the subjection of the Romans, that they were expressly prohibited
from using iron for any other purpose than agriculture. (Plin., H. N„
xxxiv„ 14, 39, ἓ 139.) Eri-’en the common story related that they were
deprived of the land which they had taken from the Veientines3 and
Niebuhr shows that they lost all the territory which the kings had
