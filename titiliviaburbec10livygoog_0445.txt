“ Since they had the right of appeal by a law of his· brother, feared
nothing harsh or tyrannical from that family.''— Confirmavit animos.
“ Established their confidence (in him). ’'-Fere conveniens. “Coin-
ciding almost exactly.’‘—Sed et homini, ete. “But having thought
that this man and his power could be more safely relied on‚’' etc„ i. e„
this man whose disposition was conciliator-y and mild, and whose
family had ever been friendly to them, and his power, which was be-
yond any control from the opposite side.

20-25. Leyiones decem. This must be a great exaggeration. At
the battle of the Allia the Romans had but four regular legione—-
Ternoe inde datoe consulibus. “ Of this number three were given to
each of the consule.’' Observe the force of the distributive. —Aut se
ipsos tuendorum, etc. Weissenborn thinks that the Latins had again
fallen under the Roman sway as in the time of Tarquinius SuperbuS,
and therefore had to ask leave to take up arms to defend themselves.
Zumpt, on the other hand, is of opinion that the old annalist5‚ from
whom Livy here copies, must have misunderstood the connection at
this time subsisting between the Romans and the LatinS, and that the
latter were quit-e independent of the former. —Retractare arma. “ To
handle arms again.’' 'l'hey feared lest they might employ them
against themselves,

in the fastnesses of their hills, and gave Vetusius no opportunity
of coming to an engagement, he was obliged to remain iunctim.—
Ad conserenda propius castra. ‘⁶ To pitch their camp nearer his.'’—
Medio inter castra campo. ‘⁶ In the interjacent plain between the
camsz’ Medius sometimes signifies “lying between;” sometimes,

“in the middle off—Quisque. The individuals of both armies are
meant.

34-45. Nec clamorem reddi. “Nor the battle-cry to be raised in
turn. '’-Coortos. “ Having arisen simultaneously.'’ Livy very cor-
rectly uses this word here, as he previously described them to have
stood “defixis pilis.” The verb consuryere he always applies to the
charge of the Triarii, for they used to await the charge of the enemy,
⁸· sinistro crure porreet0,'' or, as we would term it, with the body at rest.
—Velut stupentibus. “As if paralyzed by fem-.''—Impressionem. “A
charge.’'—Haud secus quam si, etc. They were quite taken by sur-
prise, since' they expected no resistance on the part of the Romans.
—F'acile adeptisessos. “ Having easily overtaken them wearied.''--
Plusque sanquinis factum. ‘⁴ And more bloodshed was caused. ”..·.
