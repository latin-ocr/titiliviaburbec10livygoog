“ They abruptly communicate the shocking intelligence.” Ineutio lit-
erally conveys the idea of suddenly striking into and thus secking
to excite and agitate. The false news on the present occasion was
brought by M.Vale1ius, the brother of Publicola—Famemque fami-
lia. “And that the family having been defiled,'’ i. e.‚ as having in it
an unburied empse—Non crediderit factum. “ Whether he did not
believe the fact.” Supply utrum before nort—Tantum animo roboris.
“ So much firmness in his mind.'' Supply mentally, ‘⁴ that he was
not disconcerted by the intelligence.’'—Nec interpretatio est facilis.
“ Nor is the decision an easy one.”

28-31. Nihil aliud ad eam nuntium, etc. ‘⁴ Having been turned off
fiom'the purpose in hand to this intelligence, no farther than that he
might order the body to be carried forth (for interment).” More lit-
cmlly, ‘⁶ In no other wny.’' If any omen was unexpectedly presented
to a man, while his thoughts were employed on some other subject,
this was called anyer-ium oblativum, and he was at liberty not to xe-
ceive it, as was the case with Horatius, But if he asked for an omen

from the godS, and got one, it was called impetrativwn, and he was

CHAPTER IX.

1, 2. Ad Lartem Pers-enam. ‘⁶ To Lars Porsena.'’ The term Lars
or Lai-tlt was a title of honor, given to almost all the Etruscan kings
or chiefs, and makes the genitive in Lartis or Lar-this. It probably
means “ Lord.’' On the other hand, Lar, signifying ‘⁶ a god,“ makes

’ the genitive in Laris—Porsenna. The quantity of the penult in this
word is doubtful. We might infer from the form Porsenna that the
penult was long, but we sometimes find it short in the poete. Nie-
buhr, indeed, asser-ts that Martial (Epiqr., xiv„ 98) was guilty of a de-
cided blunder in shortening the penult3 but Mr. Macaulay points out
(Lays ofAncient Rome. p. 45) that other Latin poets have committed
the same decided munder, aS, for instance, Horace in his pure Iambic
line, ‘⁶ Minacis aut Etrusca Porsenoe manus '’ (Epod., κῆ, 4), and. Sili-
us Italicus in several passages.‘ The penult, however, is not short in
all the Latin poete, ns the line of Virgil provee, “ Nec non Tarquinium
ejectura Porsena jubebat '’ (AEn.‚ viii„ 646), and the Greek writers make
it long, Πορσὴιάς (Plnt., Puta, 16), Πορσῖνος (Dionys., v., 21), ete.
It would, therefore, seem that the word was pronounced indifferently
