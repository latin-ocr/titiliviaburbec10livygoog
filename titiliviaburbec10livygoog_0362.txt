The divine law had been violated by the musgressors.—Popul·· Roma-
ιη’. The king is not mentioned, since no declaration of war could be
made without a decree of the people‚—Dedier. Old form for dedi.—
Mihi exposco. Some editions have populo Romano mihique ‚- others
nuncio populi Romani mihi,- but these are evidently mere interpola-
tiens—Siris. For ciceri-a, another old form—Paucis verbis carminis,

etc. “ A few words in the formula, and in expressing the cath hav-
ing been changed. ”

41-48. Quos exposcit. The men alone are mentioned here, the
things demanded being implied, or, in other words, the worthier
gender, to adopt the language' of the grammarianS, being employed
in preference—Tot enim sollemnes sunt. “For so many are customs
ary.’'— Coelestes. The gods are here classified, as they cannot well be
all named individually.—Inserni. The more usual form is inferi.—
Maj0res natu. ‘⁴ The fathers. ”— Omn his nuntius redit. “With these
(announcements) the messenger returns.’' Observe that cum here
merely marks accompanying circumstances.. (Zumpt, ἓ 307.)

49-53. Quarum rerum, etc. “ With respect to the articles of prop-
erty, the litigationS, the causes of complaint, about which the pater
patratus of the Roman people and the Quirites has conferi-ed with
the pater patratus of the Prisci Latini, which things they have neither
given up nor settled, nor at all acted upon.'' The expression Populi
Romani Quiritium, where et is to be supplied, has already been ex·—
plained. (Consult note on chap. xiii„ line 18.)—R-iscis Latinis. Nie-
buhr makes Prisci, in the appellation Prisci Latini, to have been the
designation of a separate people‚ some early Italian racc, aud Prisci
Latini to have been the same as Prisci et Latini ,· but this opinion is
now generally regarded as untenable‚ and the form in question to
mean merely “Old Latins.” (Consult Smsth, Dict. G'eoqr„ vol. ii.‚
p. 142.)—-Quas res nec dederunt, etc. Observe the employment here
of res to express what has been indicated by rerum, litium, and causa-
rum separately.

55-57. Puro pioque duell0, etc. “ Ι think that they ought to be
demanded by a fair and regularly declared war, and therefore 1 con-
sent and vote with those who think so.”—Duelt0. Old form for bello.
—Bellum erat consensum. ‘⁴ War was decreed by common consent, ’'
i.e., the vote of the majority was as effectual as if all were unanimous,
Zumpt, regarding this as an unusual form of expression, thinks it

. probable that Livy is quoting from some old document. The ordi-

nary construction, as he remarks, would be consensum erat de bello, οι·
consensum decretum erat de bello. Some editions read bellum erat con-
sensu, but the best manuscripts are against this.
