“ Laden besides with booty.”— Varia inde pugna, etc. “ When, after
this, pursuing and retiring as the fortune of the battle changed, they
had at last made the struggle even, yet the Romans had a greater re—
port of victory than the report of the enemy. ” Madvig objects to this
compsi-ison of two famoe, and to the omission offama 'before hostium,

CHAPTER LIII.

1-15. Ceterum, etc. “ But to no one did the victory seem greater
or more complete, ” etc. Compare justum proelium.- Qua parte. From
here down to Romanos, in line 16, is in oratio obliqua—Fore& This
use of sorem in a compound tense, instead of essem, is found in the
historians; otherwise forem, in the same signification as essm, is used
chiefly in conditional propositione, or propositione of purpose. (Mad-
vig, ξ 377, Obs, 2.)—-Militibus. The dative is never equivalent to the
genitive. The dative is the person interested in the possession, hence
the possession is emphatic; the genitive characterizes the possession
by the possessor, hence the possessor is emphatic. (Gildersleeve,
Lat. Gram„ ξ 349, Rem. 2.) “The soldiers had their courage re-
stored and refreshed.’'—-Dilatam dimicationem. “ The final struggle
(to be) delayed.'’—The perfect infinitive passive after verbs of will and
desire generally omits esse. (Madvig, ξ 407, obs. 1 and 2.)-Am·em.

“The approach of the time for the elections.’' At this period the
consuls entered office on the Ides of March.

27-41. cerneret. “ Clearly saw. '’—Haud diffidebat. The negative
haud is rare in model prose before a verb, except in the phrase haud
scio cam—Dum . . . esset, etc. The subjunctive, as giving Hannibal’s
reasons for desiring a battle—Cassarum. Impersonal. Cesso im-
plies blamable remissness or cowardly dewy—Insidiis Dative of
object for which—Pennus. The national name is introduced close to
insidiis to suggest Punica fides. “ He, being a Punic, began to look
