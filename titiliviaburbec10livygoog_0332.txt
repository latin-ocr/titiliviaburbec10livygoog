18-22. Arcebat. “Was a bari-ier.” Served as a bari-ier to the
Romans against them—Ex αρν-ξε in arbem. The country people fled
for refuge to the city, their only stronghold.—Excrtas. ‘⁴ Aroused.‘’
Consult note on chap. vii., line 28.—M=·lle passuum. “A mile.'’
Literally, “a thousand pace-§st The passus consisted of five Roman
feet. lt was not the single step (qr-adue), but the double step3 or,
more exactly, it was not the distance from hecl to heel, when the feet
were at their utmoat ordinary extension, but the distance from the
point which the heel leaves to that in which it is set down. The Ro-
man mile only differs from the English by less than one tenth.

23-25. Locis circa, densa ob sita, etc. ‘⁶ Το lie in ambuscade in the
places round about, which were dark on account of the thick brush-
wood that grew there.” The reading of the manuscripts is locis circa
densa obsita viryulta obscuris, a strange piece of Latinity, which we
may be very sure never came from the pen of Livy, and which is said
to mean, “in places hidden by thick bushes which were planted
around.” But the Latius say hcc obsita υἰνφιῖῑίε, never obsita vir-
9ulta heis. We have adopted, therefore, the very ingenious and
simple emendation of one of the early commentatorS, as quoted by
Drakenborch—Id quod quoerebat. Referring to hostem excivit.

27-31. Fuqae quoqne, quoe simulanda erat, etc. “The same mode
of fighting on the pnrt of the cavalry likewise made the cause of the
ssight which was to be counterfeited less surprising,” i. e., than it
would have been had they been infantry3 since cavalry would natu-
rally make a more desultory attack than infantry, as having horses
with which to advance and retreat when they pleased.-—-Trepidante.
“Moving about in an uncertain manner,” i. e., “appear-ing at one
moment to be advnncing to attack, at another to be retreating.”—
Plem's portis. “From the crowded gate8.''—Impulsa. “Having
been driven back. ’'

33-41. Transversam invadunt, etc. “'Attnck the enemy's army in
flank.’'—In praesidio. “ On guard.”—-Equites erant. we have given
here the reading of the later manuscripts; the earlier ones have equis
abierant—Multoque effusius. “And in much greater confusion.”——
Simulante-s. The objectos secuti erant.—A9mine uno. “In one body.’‘
Romulus is said to have occupied the city with a garrison or colony ι
of 300 men ; a number exaggerated by Plutarch to the absurd amount
of 2500 colonists, of whom he represents 2000 as shortly after cut off
by the Etrurianst As usually happens in the early history of Rome,
an traces of this Romulean colony sul.›seqnently disappear. The
