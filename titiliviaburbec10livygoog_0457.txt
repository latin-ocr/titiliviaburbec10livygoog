ΒΚ. 11.‚ cflAP. XL. 453

491 B.C.‚ mentioned in chap. xxxia, and those named here, Livy has
omitted two sets of consuIS, namely, of the year 490, Q. Sulpicius
Camerinus and Sp. Larcius Flavus3 and of 489, C. Julius Julus and
P. Pinarius Rufus Mamercinus. The omission, as Zumpt thinks, was
probably an oversight on the part of Livy himself, as there is no trace
of a gap in the manuscripts. Weissenbom', on the other hand, is
of opinion that Livy purposely indicates the omission by the em-
ployment of the particle jam.

25-32. Rea-ensem& leqionea They were holding probably a mus-
ter and review of the new levies which had been raised to repair the
losses occasioned by previous deferas—Stationem ‘⁴ OutpostS.'’ By
stationes are specially meant the advanced posts thrown forward in
front of the gates—Referre. ‘⁶ To lay before them the question.'’.—
Acceperunt relationem. “ Entertained the question.'’—Lab'are plebis
auiis-os„ “ That the spirits ‘of the plebeians were giving way.”--
Atrox responsum. “ A harsh answer.”

32-38. Si Volscis ayer redderetur, etc. The demands of Coriolanus
appear, from a comparison of the accounts of Livy and Dionysius
(viii., 35), to have been as follows: He'demanded that the territory
taken from the Volscians should be restored to them; that the col-
onies settled there should be recalled, and that the whole people
should be received as allies and isopoliteS. He allowed the Romans
the two terms of thirty—three days», fixed by the fetial law, to make
up their minds, Should these pass away, and his demands not becac-
ceded to, it would rest with him to determine what course to pursue.
Niebuhr remarks that these tei-ms are nothing else than the very sac—
rifice by which Rome, in the year 295, had the wisdom to purchase
peace with the VolscianS.—Traditum est.- nihilo anaqi-3. etc. Grono-
vius would read traditum (scil. traditum est); et nihih τηαρίε, etc.
This would make the ‚sentence somewhat more simple, though there
are many instances of ·the·present reading.

CHAPTER XL.

3-18. Id melicum consilium. “ Whether this was a state meas-
ure.” S⁶upply utrum before id. Dionysius says (viii., 39) that this
step was recommended by Valeria, the sister of Publicola. Plutarch
gives his wife’s name as Virgilia.——In primo. “At first.'' An un-
usual form for primo. The preposition, though defended by some, is
probably erroneous here—Publica majestate in leqatis. “By the
majesty of the state (represented) in its ambassadorS.'’ Tanta effusa
oculis, etc. “By so great religious sanctiry poured forth upon the
eyes and the imaginationi in the persons of the priests.”—Insi9nem.
