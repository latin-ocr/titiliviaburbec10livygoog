for he says, in the next chapter, “ Proximo bello, in ipsa acie, 'in ipso
certamine, consensu exercitus, traditam ultro victoriam victis AEquis.’'
The old reading of almost all the manuscripts and printed copies was
Fabio in Veientes, in AEquos Furio datur, but this destroys the con-
sistency of the passage.

20-27. Veientibus. The old reading is AEquis. Consult preceding
note. —Ipse consul. “ Himself (alone) a consul,'’ i. e., alone display-
ing the true spirit of one. This is said as a contrast to the move-
ments of his colleagueL—Imperatorias artes. “Qualities as a com-
mander.”—-Nec illos, etsi non, etc. ‘⁴ Nor, although the exhortation
of their leader‚‘wh'om they hated, was not (able to effect this), could
their own infamy at least, and the public disgrace at present, and
danger soon after, if courage should have returned to the foe, compel
them to accelerate their pace, or if (they did) nothing else, stand in
order of battle.” We have given, in the last line of this passage,
stare, the correction of MuretuS, instead of the common reading in-
stare, which cannot be defended, although many have sought to do
so·

32-36. ·Navatam ab equite operam. ‘⁴ The· assistance rendered by
the cavalry.'' Equivalent to equitem quod navaverit operam—Adeo ex-
cellentibus inqeniis, etc: “ Τσ such a degree, unt-o transcendent abil-
ities, is the tact more likely to be wanting‚'’ etc„ i. e., so true it is
that to transcendent abilitie5‚ etc.—OEtius defuerit. More literally‚
‘⁶ Likely sooner to be wanting.’' Observe the force of the potential
desuerit—Obtinuere. “ Gained their point.” Compare chap. xlii„
line 9. —- Ut in Fabia yente consulatus maneret. The extraordinary
fact, says Niebuhr, that for seven consecutive years, from 269 to 275,
one of the scats in the consulship was always filled by a member of
the Fabian house cannot have been the result of accident. It was
the price paid by the older tribes to the powerful house in question for
their support in an attempt to exclude the lesser houses from the
consulship.

CHAPTER. XLIV.

1-13. Auctorem leqis ayo-arim. “ As the advocate of the agrarian
law.” Not “ as the author of an agrarian law,'’ for the reference is
to the law of Cassiae, which was again, as before, sought to be car-
ried through—Tib. Contraction for Tiberius—Velut 'processisset
Licinio. ‘⁴ As if success had attended Liciniu5.'’ More literally, “ As
if it had succeeded t'o LiciniuS.’' The verb is here taken imperson-
ally, though more commonly construed with a subJect.——-In praesentia
re, etc. “ For the present by the very fact (of the defeat of Licinius),
for all future time by the precedent (which had been established)‚”
