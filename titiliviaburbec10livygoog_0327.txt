Livy would appear to derivo it from firo. Others deduce it from
finem-um, the frame ou which the spoils were carried. And others
again from ferire, ‘⁶ to strike.'’ This last is thewvorst.—Quas modo
animo metatus sum. “Which I have just marked out in thought‚’'
i. e., in intention.—Sedem‚ ‘⁴ A repository.'’- Opimis spoliis. Those
which the commander-in-chief of a Roman army stripped in a field
of battle from the leader of the foe—Quod pri-mum omnium, etc. The
temple of Jupiter Feretrius stood on the north-east summit of the
Capitoline mount. In the time of Dionysius the foundations alone
remained, and he gives the dimensione at 10 feet by 5. It appears,
however, to have been subsequently restored by Augustus.

30-33. Vocem. ‘⁴ The declaration. ”— Nec multitudine compotum,
etc. “ And that the glory of his offering should not be made com-
mon by the great number of those that shared it. ’'—Bina postea, etc.
Observe the employment of the distributive with spolia opima on ac-
count of the peculiarly plural force of the expression. (Zumpt, ᾗ 119.)
The two instances of offering up the spolia opima, besides that of
RomuluS, were in the case of Aulus Cornelius Cossus, who slew aud
despoiled Lars TolumniuS, king of the Veientes; and of M. Claudius
Marcellus, who bore away the same spoils from Viridommum, king ¹of
the Gaesatae. These were the only three instances of the kind that
occurred in Roman history. The honors of the spolia opima were
voted‚ it is true, to Julius Caesar, during his fifth consulship (B.C. 44,
the year of his death), but it was not even pretended that he had any
legitimate claim 'to this distinction.

 

CHAPTER XI.

2-7. Per occasionem ac solitudinem. “ Through the opportunity
thus afforded, as well as the unguarded state (of the frontiers),” i. e.,
the opportunity afforded by, etc—Romana leqio. The Roman army
appears first as a legion, aud according to Dionysius (ii., 16) of 3000
inem—Raptim. “ By hurried marcheS.''—Ovantem. “Exulting.” .
The term here has no reference to what was subsequently called the
ovatio, or minor triumph—Hersilia conjunx. Hersilia was the only
married woman carried off by the Romans in the rape of the Sabine
femaleS. Her name vis probably a later and a Greek addition to the
original story of Romulus As Romulus after death became Quirian
so those writers who made Hersilia his wife raised her to the dignity
of a goddeSS, Hora οι· Horta, in either case, probably, with reference
to boundaries of time (ὥρα) οι· space (ὅρος).

appears to hare been purely fabulous. Compare note on chap-
