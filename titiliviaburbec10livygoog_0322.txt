terior. ’'-Lictor-ibus. The lictor was a public officer attached ιο the
service of certain Roman magistr-atesi, whom he preceded whenever
they went abroad. He carried the fasces with the axe in the centre
on his left shoulder‚ and a rod (virga) in his right haud.

9-13. Me haud poem'tet‚etc. “1 am quite willing to be of the
opinion of those. ’' The verb poem‘tet is not unfreqnently employed to
express merely a feeling of dissatisfaction or unwillingness.—Appa-
ritores hoc qenes. ‘⁴ Attendants of this class. '¹ Hoc yenus is the ac-
cusative of nearer definition. The term apparitores was the general
name for the public servants of the magistrates at Rome, including
lictorS, accensi, viatores, etc. The common text has et apparitores et

hoc yenus, ‘⁴ both the attendants in general, and this particular class .

of them.’' This reading, however, cannot be correct, since we have
no proof that the apparitores all came from Etruria, and since the
reference here is a special one to number. · It is far better therefore
to remove the et before hoc, and to place it before numerum. [As to
the derivation of all these things from Etruria, modern critics see

aediles, etc. - Taya praetexta. A toga ornamented with a broad border
of purple, worn by the chief magistrates—Et ita habuisse Etruscos.
“And that the Etrurians had this number.'’ Literally, “So had
them.'’—-Ex duodecim populis, etc. Etruria was a confederacy of
twelve cities, each of which was a sovereign and independent state.

· 15-21, Alia atque alia appetendo loca. “ By taking in various
places one after the other with its fortificationS.” More literally,
‘⁴ Now one, now another.’'—Mum'rent. They included a wider space
within the line of walls than the population of the city seemed at the
time to require, but they did this with a view to future accessions of
inhabitants—Vana. ‘⁶ UselesS.”—- Vetere consilio, etc. “ In accord-
ance with the old policy of the founders of eities.” Participle again
for a noun—Locum qui nunc septus, etc. “He opens as an asylum
the place which is now enclosed to those who go down (from the
Capitol) between the two groveS.” That is, the enclosed space com-
pels those who come down from the Capitol to make a circuit around
ιι. Becker (Haud, p. 387) assumes that the Asylum occupied the

and that this space, which by modern topographers has been called
