’ ΟΗΑΡΤΕΒ LI.

1-l l. Ohdes est. Not esset, as some read, because this would imply
that Horatius and Menenius were consuls after the defeat of the Fabii
had taken place, whereas it plainly appears from the next chapter
(quum Ιιαυᾰ procul inde stativa consul habuisset) that Menenius was
consul during the disaster. —Super bellum. “Over and above the
war.''—Institit. “ Threatened.''—Ad Spei. Supply oedem. This tem-
ple was about a mile from the city.—Portam Collinam. This was the
most northerly of all the gateS, and lay near the point where the Via
Salaria branched off from the Via Nomentana. It took its name from
the adjacent Collis Quirinalia—Parvo momento. “By but a slight

preponderance.” More literally, ‘⁴ 'rum of the scale.'’—Meliorem.
The Greek ἀμείνονα.

15-22. Velut ab arce Janiculi. “ From the Janiculum‚ as if it were
their fortresS.’' For a Janicuh velut arca—Secu& dedita opera, etc.
“ Having pursued some cattle intentionally driven out in every direc-
tion for a decoy, they plunged headlong into an ambuscade.’'—Atrox.
“ Bitter.'’ —— Major. For eo major. A common ellipsis. — Adorti
sunt. Used here in its primitive sense. Compare Donatus, Ad Ter.
Andr„ 3, l, 21 ε ‘⁶ Adortus dicitur, qui ex insidiis repente invadit.''

25-31. Ferox. “ Elated.''—Mayis tamen, quod, etc. “ More, how-
ever, because want of provisions drove him into measures however
rash, provided they were more expeditious.”—Adverso Janiculo‚ etc.
‘⁴ He rashly marched his army up the Janiculum.'' It would appear
from this that the J aniculam at this time was detached from the city.
As regards the phrase eriyit aciem, compare bk. i., chap. xxvii„ line 23.
—Occidione occi-si. ‘⁴ Were slain with utter slaughter,” i. e., were cut
t'o pieces. An expression of frequent occurrence in Livy.—-Oppres-
sum. “ Was put·a sudden stop to.‘’ opprimere is often employed,
in describing military operations, to deuote some sudden and unex-
pected act.

 

CHAPTER LII.

1-13. Laxior annona. “ A less straitened market.”-Abditum sue-
rat. ‘⁶ Had been boarded up.''-—Suo veneno. “With their (old)
poison.''- Universos. “All collectively.''—Invidia erat, etc. “ The
loss of the post on the Cremera afforded a ground of odium (against
him). ’⁹ Niebuhr remarks that, in whatever way the Fabii may have
pet-ishad, they were without doubt sacrificed. They could easily have
been saved by Menenius. —E'a oppressit. ‘⁴ This (odium) crushed
him.” Supply invidia. The editions generally have eum oppresserant.
Many MSS„ however, have eam oppressit, from which Gronovius de‹
