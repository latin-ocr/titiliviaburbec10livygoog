tax upon objects without iegard to their produce, like a land or house ⁴
taX, which indeed formed the main part of it. (Niebuhr, H. R„ vol. i.‚
p. 581.)—Plebes. Equivalent here to pauperes, which latter term
again is the same as proletarii or capite cerasi—Qui ouer-{ferendo essent.
“who might be able to bear the burden.‘’ This construction of
esse with the dative of the gerund is usually explained by an ellipsis
of idoneus ,- but it is better not to have recourse to an ellipsiS, and ω
consider it analogous to the expression auxilio alicui esse. (Zumpt,
ἓ 664, note l.)—Satis stipendii. “ Tax enough.”-Si liberos educerent.
“If they brought up their children.’' The reference is to physical
education merely. The manuscripts have educent, which appears to
have arisen by abbreviation (educ’ent) from educerent. Many editions
have educarent, but this refers to moral education, which the pauperes
could not afford to give.

 

CHAPTER X.

1-11. Pro se quisque. “ Each for himself,” i. e., as best he could.
——Sepiunt proesidii& The parts that were not sufficiently strong they
make secure by military posta—Tiberi offecto, On this side there-
fore there were no walls. —Pons sublicius iter poeue, etc. ‘⁶ The sub—
lician bridge almost afforded a passage to the enemy, had there not
been‚” etc., i. e.‚would have afforded‚ etc. Historical writers often
employ the perfect indicative instead of the pluperfect subjunctive, to
render a description more animated, and to indicate that a part of the
inference has already come to pass, and that the whole would have been
realized if some obstacle had not been thrown in the way. (Zumpt,
ξ 519.)-Munimentmn. ‘⁴ Bulwark.”-Jam·culwn. Compare bk. i.‚
chap. xxxiii„ line 24.- OEtatos. “At full speed.”—Reprel1ensans‚
An unusual form, employed to express frequency of action.'— Obsis-
tens. ‘⁶ standing in their way. ”—Testabatur. ‘⁴ He assured them.''
Observe the poetic tinge in obtestans . . . testabatur. —Proesidia “ Their
post,'’ i. e., the J aniculum, where they had been stationed.

12, 13. So· transitum pontem, etc. “ If they should have left the
bridge after having been crossed by them in their rear, ” i. e., if they
crossed the bridge and left it behind them. As we can say in the
active transeo pontem, so we can have in the passive transitus pons.
Some less correctly read transitui, or else make transitum a substan-
tive in apposition with pontem. Compare “ Alpes transitoe,’' bk. xxi„
chap. xliii„ line 12, and “ Amne transito,'' bk. xxiii„ chap. xxviii.—
Jam. “That soon.”

13—18. Monere, proedioere. Historical infinitives. Many editions,
less correctly‚ connect these in construction with the previous clause3

“ That he therefore charged, that he warned them.'’—Possint. The
