2-8. ooelim additur urbi mons, The Caelian hill is said to have de-
rived its name from the Etrurian leader Caeles vibenna, who came to
Rome to lend aid, at the invitation of either Romulus& one of the
early Roman kings, and settled here with his troops. Compare Nie-
buhr, H. R„ vol. i.‚ p. 381, seq.; Miiller, Etrusker, vol. i.‚ p. 116, seqq.
...Fr-squamus. ‘⁶ More thiekly.’'—Eam sedem T ullus reyioe capit, etc.
Other accountS, however, represent him as dwelling on the Velia. (Cic,
Rep„ ii. , 3 1 .)- Tullios. Dionysius (iii., 29) mentions the Jult'i⁹ instead
of the Tullii, but, as Zumpt remarks, Livy has already, in chap. xvi„
spoken of a Julius Proculus as a man of influence in the state. The
Julian gens, therefore, though itself of Alban origin, was earlier than
the time of TulluS, and the true reading here is undoubtedly Tullios,
—Templwuque ordini, etc. ‘⁴ And, as a consecrated place of meeting
for the order, (thus) augmented by himself, he built a senatehouse,
which was called the Hostilian even to the time of our fathers,”
Templum means generally any place set spart and hallowed by the
augurs for either religione or state purpose& The curia Hostilia was
burned down before the time of Livy, aud in consequence of some
prodigies that occurred in the year before Caesar's assassination it
was resolved to rebuild it. At the time when this decree was made
Caesar was pontifex maximus, but he did not live even to begin the ,
new structure. Augustus subsequently erected it, and it was named
after its new founder Curia Julia. (smith, Dict. Geoqr„ vol. ii„ p.789.)

ll, 12. Equitum decem turmas. “ Ten troops of equites.’' The
turma consisted at first of thirty, afterwards of thirty-two men. The
number here added, then, was three hundred, so that now the equites
consisted of six hundred mem—Explevit. “ He recruited.'’—Eodem

Etruscos. “ Next to the Etrurian8.''-Feronioe sanum. The temple
of Feronia was in southern Etruria, at the foot of Mount Soracte,
within the territory of Capena, and had a sacred grove attached to it.
In process of time a town grew up· around. Feronia appears to have
been a Sabine goddess (Varro, L. L.‚ V„ 74), and hence the festivals
at her shrine seem to have been attended especially by the SabineS‚
though the sanctum-y itself was in the Etrurian territory, and depend-
ent upon the neighboring city of Capena. Great numbers of people
