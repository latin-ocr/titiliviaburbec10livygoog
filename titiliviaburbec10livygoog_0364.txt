20-23. oran-‘bus mpii-r ωπηὶειιε. “ Having made a vigor-oua effort ἢ
with all his forces.’'—Aeie. ‘⁶ Iu a pitched battle. ’² Dionysius says

he took Medullia at this same time—Ad Murcia. “Near the tem-
ple of Murcia.” Supply oedem, which is frequently omitted with the
names of divinities. Mmu’a was a surname of Venus at Rome, and
this appellation is said to have been the same as M ,γι-τω (from myrtus,
“a myrtle'')‚ indicating the fondness of the goddess for that trec.
There is said to have been a myrtle grove in frout of her temple at
the foot of the Aventius.

24, 25. Janiculum. This hill lay across the Tiber‚ and began at
that point opposite the Campus Martius where the river reaches far-
thest to the west, whence it stretched in a southerly diiection to a
point opposite the Aventina—Quando. “ At any time. ’⁹ For ali-
quanda—Arx hostium. “ A stronghold for the foe.'’ The enemy
here particularly meant are the Etruriam, against whom the Jani-
culum formed a natural outpost.—Non niuniri solum, etc. The manu-
scripts have non muro solum, which all the editions follow. But, as
Duker remarks, we must either suppose something to have been
dropped from the text, οι( else must supply cinyi after muro by a
kind of zeugma from conjunyi which follows farther on, since there
is no proof that the Janiculum was joined at this time by a wall to
the city. Neither of the suppositione, however, thus started by
Duker, is at all satisfactory, and we have preferred therefore to in-

troduce the very ingenious conjecture of Scheller, namely, muniri in ,

place of muro, This, mot-cover, would seem to derive probability ’

{rom the language of Dionysius, who merely employs the term
τειχισε.

26, 27. Ponte sublicio. “ By the Sublician bridge‚” i. e„ the pne- ³
bridge. This structure, the oldest and one of the most frequently ³
mentioned of the Roman bridgeS, took its name from the sublime, or ’

wooden piles on which it rested. It was considered of such ‘religious
importance thnt it was under the special care of the pontifices, and
was repaired from time to time even down to the reign of Antoninus
Pius. (Capitol., Ant„ chap. viii.) Nay, it would seem to have existed in
the time of Constantine, since it is mentioned in the Notitia. In cou-
sequence, it is said, of the delay and difficulty experienced in breaking
it down in the well-known feat of Horatius Cocles, it was reconstructed
without nails, in such a manner that every beam could be removed
aud replaced at pleasure. (Plin., H. N„ xxxvi„ 15, 23, ξ 100.) It

was considered so sacred that no repairs could be made in it without .

previous sacrifice conducted by the pontifex in person—Quiritium
quoque fossa, etc. “ The Quin’tes' ditch, moreover, no trifling defence
on those quarters which were more level (and consequently easier) to
be approached (than the rest).” Adita, as Doring remarks, is the
