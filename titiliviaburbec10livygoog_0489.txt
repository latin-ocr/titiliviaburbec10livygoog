were elected, probably for life, by the people‚ under certain restrictione
ais to families. The Council consisted of several hundred members,
from whom were chosen the Gerusia or Senate of One Hundred, und
the Pentarchies or Commissions of Five, which managed the van'ous
departments of state. Originally the Suffetes commanded the fleets
and armieS, but these military functions were afterwards assigned to
generals elected by the people. The aristocratic character of this
constitution was maintained by public opinion, which was in favor
of power resting with the rich.

The armies of Carthage consisted of a nucleus of citizens and Liby-
Phoenice8‚ and large bodies of mercenaries, raised partly from the
Numidians and Mauritanians, partly from the Ligurians of Italy, the
Celte of Gaul, and the Iberians of Spain. Her fleet was always nu-
merous; the officere and sailors being Carthaginian‚ the rowers slaves
of the state3 and it rendered her for several centuries undisputed mis-
tress of the Western and Centrnl Mediterranean‚ her only rivals being
the Etruscans. Rivals though they were, they joined forces to destroy
the Phocaean fleet in about B.C. 550, when the PhocaeanS, after found-
ing Massilia, and opening a trade with TartessuS, endeavored to get
a footing in Corsica. In B.C. 508 was concluded the treaty between
Carthnge and Rome mentioned by Polybius. Carthage, succeeding
to the influence of Tyre over the Phoenician colonies in Sicily, and
dreading interference with her trade by the intruding GreekS, soon
formed a desire to conquer the whole of that island. Defeated in
B.C. 480, she returned in Rc, 409, but, after a century of warfare,
had not succeeded in gaining a foot of ground. At the opening of
the First Punic War she held rather more than a third of the island,
her possessione lying to the west and south, and including Agrigentum.
Deprived by that war of Sicily and Sardinia, she was induced by the
Barciue faction (as Livy styles the war party headed by Hamilcar
Barca) to seek for compensation in Spain, and by the year B. C. 220
had established her power over the southern and south-eastern dis-
tricts, where Phoenician influence had been for centuries diffused from
the great colonies of Tartessus and Gades. In the year B.C. 218
Hannibal formed the siege of Saguntum, and the twenty-first book of
Livy begine.

 

Rome now appears as the mistress of Italy, maintaining her power
by a system of colonias and alliances. The socii were eitherfoederati
united by treaties to Rome, or liberi, possessing autonomy subject to
the good-will of Rome. 'Phe nomm Latinum designates the Latius of
Latium and the Latin colonieS, i. e., colonies possessing the Latin
franchise whatever might be the nationality of the colonistS. The
cohnioe civium Romanorum consisted of citizens who retained the rights
they would have had at Rome. (Liv., bk. xxxix, chap. lv.) Of the
