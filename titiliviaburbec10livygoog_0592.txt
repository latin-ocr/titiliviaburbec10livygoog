CHAPTER LX.

3-7. Tendebat. Namely‚ the kindred of the prisonem who formed
the nrm-Sibe “To them‚’' i. e., the snppliants. —Neoessitas.
“The pressure of necessity, '' as they feared to lose their protectors.
-Submotis arbitris. ‘⁴ When all spectatore had been made to with-
draw,” from the doors or elsewhere. Weissenborn, however, con-
siders arbitri to mean the delegates from the captives—consuli. The
manner in which the Senate was consulted was that the senators
were separately asked to state their opinions: they could preface
their votes by speecbes.

8-13. De publico. “From the public treasuryf—Praedibnsqne ac
proedit‘s. ‘⁶ By sureties and their property. '' A common legal term.
The law required the sureties to be citizens holding their' property
in full quiritarian ownership. Praes is a surety for one who owen
money to the state, and his goods are styled praedia, which Gaius, ii„
61, defines as res obliyatae populo. Hence proedibus cavere (Diffi, x.,
3, ᾗ 6) οι· ρνωᾱὶὁω proediisque cavere (Cic. in Ver-r.. ii. (1), 54, ἓ 142)
is “to give security.'’—-T. Manlius Torquatus. He had been twice
consul, in B.C. 235 and B.C. 224, and censor in B.C. 231. His
first consulship is memorable from the fact that the temple of J anus
was closed in that year for the first time since Numa’s reign. In
the year after the battle of Cannoe he commanded with success in
Sardinia against the Carthaginians and the revolted nativ-es whom he
had reduced in his first consulship. In B.C. 210 he refused the
consulship, and died B.C. 202. The stemness and brutal severity of
the family was proverbial. L. Manlius, dictator in B.C. 363, ob-
tained the name Imperiosus from his tyranny and crnelty3 and his son,
'1‘.Manlius, gave rise to the expression Manliana imperia, by the
execution of his son for engaging‚ contrary to orders, in single com-
bat with a Latin, before the great battle (Β Ο. 340) near Mt. Vesu-
vius which established the supremacy of Rome. —Pn‘seoe severitatis.
The descriptive genitive is generally subjoincd to an indefinite appel·
lative noun3 and the omission here of some w·01d like vir is quit-e
exceptional. See Madvig, ᾗ 287, Obs, 33 Zumpt, ς’ 426.-—-Interro-
yetus sententiam. “ Having been asked for his opinion. ’⁹

17-38. Quid mim assud. For the ellipsis of some part of faeere m
phrases like the present,- equu alent to‘ ‘merely‚” see Zumpt, § 771,
and Madvig, 5479, d, Obs. 5.— —Prwfwi Supply se. The clause is
dependent on ‹eq-uum censuerint. —G'uJusque. “Of each of the com-
buttnts. '’—P. Sempronius. See the account in chap. l.‚ line 20. Εἰ
ipsis-that is, as well as the Romans. —Possent. A general state-
ment true for all time, as the words per consertos compared with ph-
risque reyressis show. ——Monere adhortari. An asyndeton as in bk.
