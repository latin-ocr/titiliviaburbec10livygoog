CHAI'TER. XXXIX.

1, 2. Eo tempore, etc. The account of the early life and death of
Servius Tullius is full of marvels, and cannot be regarded as possess-
ing any title to a real historica! narrative. According to the general
tradition, he was of servile origin, and owed his elevation to the favor
of the goda, and especially to the protection of the goddess Fortune,
with whom he was always a favorite. His mother, Ocrisia, according
to this same tradition, a female slave of the queen, and one of the
captives taken at Corniculum, was offering cakes to the Lar, or house-
hold genius, when she saw in the fire on the hearth an apparition of
the deity. Tanaquil, who understood the portent, commanded her to
dress herself as a bride, and to shut herself up in the chamber. There
she became pregnant by the god, whom some Romans maintained to
be the household genius, and others Vulcan3 the former supporting
their opinion by the festival which Servius established in honor of the
LareS, the latter by the tradition that the statue of Servius was placed
in the temple of Fortune, and remained unhurt when the temple it-
self was once destroyed by fire. (Ox-id„ Fast.,vi., 625 seqq. ; Dionys,
iv., 2.) There are two other legends respecting the birth of Servius
which have more of an historical air, and may therefore be regarded
as of later origin. One related that his mother was a slave from
Tarquinii, that his father was a client of the king, and that he him-
self was brought up in the palace with the other household slaves,
and waited at the royal table. (Cic, De Rep.‚ ii., 21.) The other
legend, which gives Servius a nobler origin, and which is therefore
preferred by both Dionysius and Livy, is related by the latter at the
close of the present chapter.

C'ui Servio Tullio fuit nomen. The Etrurian tradition respecting
Servius was entirely different from those just mentioned, and made
him a native of Etruria. This tradition was related by the emperor
Claudius, in a speech made upon the admission of some Lugdunensian
Gauls into the Senate, and fragments of which are still preserved. Iu
this speech Claudius says that, according to the Etrurian account,
Servius was the faithful companion of Coeles Vibenna‚ and shared all
his fortunes3 that at last, being oven-powered by a variety of disasters,
he quitted Etruria with the remains of the army which had served un-
der CaeleS, went to Rome, and occupied the caelian hill, calling it so
after h1s former commendem that he exchanged his Etrurian name,
