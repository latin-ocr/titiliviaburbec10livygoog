of changing it to retinerent, as some editors <la—Royan jussisset.
Consult note on chap. xxii„ line 4.—Id sic ratum esset, etc. “It
should be valid on this express condition, if the fathers, namely, should
give it their sanction.” Observe here the force of sic. The term
auctor (which contains the same clement as any-eo) signifieS, properly,
one who enlarges, coufirms, or gives to a thing its completeness and
efficient form. The numerous technical significations of the word are
all derivable from this general notion. The expression “patres auc-
tores fiunt” means that the determinations of the populus in the
comitia centuriata were confirmed by the patricians in the comitia

‘ curiata. (Smith, Dict. Ant„ s. v. Auctor.) [Patres auctores, Seeley,

quoting cic„ De Domo, 14, and Livy, vi„ 41, concludes that the kx
curiata was distinct from the auctoritas patrum. The proceedings of
the comitia aar-iata were ratified in early times by the Senate, in later
times by the patrician part of the Senate, to whom, for some religious
reasons, certain privileges had been left]

29, 30. Uswpatur,idem jus, vi adempta. “ The same (constitutional)
form of authority is observed, its efficacy (however) having been taken
away.” In the fifth century of the city the change began. By one
of the laws of the plebeian dictator, Q. Publilius Philo, it was enacted
(Liv. viii„ 12) that in the case of laws to be enacted at the comitia
centuriata, the fathers should give their assent before the vote of the
comitia centuriata was taken. By a lex Moenia, of uncertain date
(Cic., Brut„ c. 14), the same change was made as to elections which
the Publilia lex had made as to the enacting of laws. This will
serve to explain the language of Livy in the text.—In incertam even-
tum, etc. ‘⁶ The fathers give their sanction with respect to the un-
certain issue of the comitia‚'’ i. e.‚ to the decision of the comitia, be-
fore it has been made, and while it is still uncertain what that decision
will be. [Contione. A contio was summoned by a magistrate pre-
paratory to the comitia.- in the latter voting took place3 in the
former there was nothing but speaking]

32-36. Quod bonum‚saustam, etc. “A thing which (Ι pray) may
be good, auspiciouS, and fortunate.'’ The usual formula before en-
tering on any business», and marked by the tautology in which such
forms are usually couched.—Di9num qni nwneretur. “One worthy
to be counted.” The relative has here the force of ut.—Victi bene-
ficio. ‘⁴ Outdone in generosity.'’—Scisoerent‚ juberentque. Another
legal formula. 'Sciscere is the technical term to denote a decree of
the plebs. and jubere one by the populus. [Regarding Niebuhr-'s
theory of a distinction between the popalus and plebs as traceable in
Livy, Madvig writes, “The opinion that populus means patricians as
distinguished from the pleRS, is based on no arguments, and needs no ·
refutationi]
