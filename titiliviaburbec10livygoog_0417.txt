—— ²¹'Iullo majus morti doeusfuit. “Was a much greater honor -to his
de xth‚'' i. e., to the deceased. -Ammm This was a year of ten monthS‚

such being at that time the length of the Roman year, as appointed by
Numa. Tradition says that this was the period of time which the
same king had fixed for widows to go into mourning for their hus-
bands.—Tam acer altor. “ So strenuous an avenger.''

18—21. Exfavore. “After populaiity.”— Oum atroci crimine. “ Conp-
led with a heinous charge.''—In summa Velia. The position of the
Velia has been made a matter of much discussion among antiquari-
ans. It would seem to have been the rising ground between the Pal-
atine, the Esquiline, and the eastern side of the Forum-A lto atque
naunito loeo. Cicero (De Rep„ ii„ 31) says that Valerius built on the
same spot where Tullus Hostilius had previously dwelt—Aroem inex-
pugnabilwafieri. “ An impregnable stronghold was being erected.‘'
The common text has sore, for which we have substituted fieri, with
Weissenborn and others. Some manuscripts havefiert‘ fore, the eop-
yists evidently being uncertain which was the true reading, and leav-
ing it therefore to the choice of the reader.

22, 23. Indiynit‘ate. “By a sense of their unworthinessss M—Sum
missis fascibus. ‘The fasces having been lowered,’' i. e., in token of
respect to the majesty of the people.L21vy omits to state here what
is mentioned by Dionysius (ι, 19), and by himself also in another
passage (bk. xxiv, chap.' DL), that Valerius took away the securis from
the fascea so long as the consuls were within the city.·-In contionem
escendit. ‘⁴ He mounted a high place for the purpose of delivering
an harangue.” The steps of the ouria Hostilia are probably meant.

27-35. Ibo· audire jussis. “Then being ordered to listen,’' i. e.,
being called to silence. The more usual reading is ubi affre jussi,
but this is less spirited—Mortem occubuisset. “He had encountered
death.”—Ad crimen atque invidiam. “For accusation and calumny,”
i. e., as an object of these—Ex liberatore patrioe, etc. “ That he had
fallen back (in their estimation) to a level with the Aquilii and Vitel-
lii, from having been regarded as the liberator of his country. '’-Ntm-
quamne erqo, etc. The transition from the oratio obliqua to the oratio
recta most happily expresses the excitement of the speaker.-Adeo a

gobis spectata. “ So fully proved by you.'’—Subiturum. “ Would un-
, ergo.”

37-45. Tam kvt' momento, etc. ‘⁴ Does my reputation hang with so
light a weight in the balance ?’‘ i. e., when my reputation and your sear
of my making myself king are weighed against each other, does the
former hang with so light a weightin the scales i—Adeone est fundata,
etc. “ Is my credit so.lightly established ?”——-Non obstabunt. “ shall
