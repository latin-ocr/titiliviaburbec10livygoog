2-10. Non tamen bellatum. “ No war, however, was waged.''—Sti-
pendio. “ Money.’' Stipendium is properly the pay of soldierS, and
money raised for that purpose. It cannot, however, mean pay here,
since the Roman soldiers did not receive pay until sevemy years after
this time, in 405. In later times it was usual to exact a contribution
of corn and money for the troops from conquered enemieS, before
granting -them peace or a cessation of hostilitieS. Here, however, as

experience.—Apparitori. Compare bk. i., chap. viii.‚ line 10.—Si se
