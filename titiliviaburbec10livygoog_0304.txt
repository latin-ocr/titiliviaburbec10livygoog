“ Finally‚ a revolution takes place, and the king for life is super-
seded by two magistrates holding power only for a year.'’

The early annals of the Republic‚ given in bk. ii., are as little
adapted as those of the kings to afford a firm historical footing.
The most important point is the rise of the plebeians and the growth
of the Tribunician power. The aristocratic revolution which expelled
the Tar-quin family left the roynl power in the hands of two magis-
trateS, originally called Praetors‚ who were annually elected by the
comitia centuriata. These Praetors had the power of filling vacan-
cies in the Senate, and of calling it together.

The Senate seems at first to have had the power of nominating to
the comitia centuriata the persons to be elected Proetors. In the
comitia centuriata the voting was by centuries, and wealth had most
influence3 in the comitia curiata the voting was by curiae. To these
two assemblies all the people, patricians and plebeians alike, belonged.
