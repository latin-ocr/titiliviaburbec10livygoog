buried‚ it would be impr-oper to name him by his divine title. The
parenthesis here refers to the doubt existing'in the mind of the his·
torian. The popular name is given immediately after. —Super Numi-
cium flumen. “On the bank of the river Numicius.” The Numi-
ciuS, or NumicuS, now Rio Torto, was a small river of Latium, be-
tween, Lavinium and Ardea. ,

Jovem indiqetem aypellunt. “ They call him Jupiter Indige8.'’
⁵The teum indiyes (plur. indiyetes) was properly applied to deified
heroeS, who thus became what may be termed ‘⁴ native deitie8‚’' and
protectore and guardians of the land. The indiqetes ἀεί were analo-
gous therefore to the δαίμονες ἐπιχώριοι of the Greeks, Hartung con-
nects them in some degree with the penates (Bal. der Remea, i. , 81—93).
The expression Jupiter Indiqes, therefore, would be somewhat analo·
gons to “Father and native god.'' Dionysius (l. c.) calls AEneas a
θεὸς χθόνιος.

6-10. Haud ambiqam. “1 will not enter into any dissension.”
Many editions give haud nihil ambiyam, assigning to atnbiyo here the
meaning of dubito, and translating, “ I will not assert as a thing be-
yond doubt,” or “1 have some douth.” But the manuscripts all
omit nihil, and with very good reason, since Livy employs ambiyo here,
not in the sense of ‘⁴ to doubt,” but in that of ‘⁴ to discuss” or “to
dispute3'''—Hicinefuervit Ascanius, etc. From this it would seem that
some traditione distinguished between an earlier and a later Ascaniu8‚
the one a son of Creusa, and the other of Lavinia.—Obmesque inde
paternoe fuyoe. Homer knows nothing of Ascanius, Later poets
make him either to have fled with his father, or else to have founded
a ew kingdom in Asia Minor.—Quem Iulum eundem. “ Whom, at
the same time IuluS,'' i. e.‚ whom, called also IuluS. On the force of
idem, here consult Zumpt, ἓ 127.

i. e.‚ considering those times. It was a flourishing und popfflous city,

afterwards—Albano monte. The Alban Mount, now Monte Cave,
