CHAPTER XLVI.

3-18. Gallos Hispanosque. These were Hannibal’s heavy cavalry,
sun-passing in number the heavy Roman cavalry opposed to them.—
Peditibus. The instrumental ablativa-Afrorum utraque, etc. “ So
that both flanks consisted of Afrieans.”—0rederes. The imperfect
subjunctive as the potentini of the past, with the ideal second person.
—Soeta The ‚cutm covered the whole body, but was antrom—
Pmoetan. “Pointwise;” anaim, “edgewise.”—Proetextis purpura.
‘⁴ Bordered with purple.” The Roman soldiers had scarlet and black
plumes a foot and a half high.

22-27. Hasdrubal. The commender os the baggage train and com·
missar-iat parties. Hannibal with Mago took command of the centre‚
because here the decisive manoeuvres were to be exesum, and be-
cause the arrangement of his forces was such as to require at that
point a general of consummate skill, ready for any emergency.—
Lomtis. Supply iis. It is a dative, like utrique parti, dependent on
obliquus παι- Volturnus. The sirocco blows most violently in May
and June. -Adveo-m. “ Blowing straight against the Romans. ”

1-9. Quia nullo circa, etc. “,Because with no space aronnd left
for wheeling, on the one side the river, on the other the line οἱ· m-
fantry shut them in, as they pushed straight onwarssds '—Nitentes.
Supply viros. Madvig puts a full stop after claudebant and begins a
fiesh sentence with In directum—Confidis turba: “Wedged together
by the mass. ”

 

14-24. Sub equestris finem. “On the conclusion of the cavalry
combat.'’—Parumper. So Polybius, ἐπὶ βραχύ. Madvig reads par,
duno.—-AEqua. Madvig reads obliqua. The emphasis is on densa,
which here means consertis ordinibus—Cumana. Not exactly. The
centre of the Gauls and Spaniards formed a crescent ohtwards.—-In·
sistere. Historic infinitivo. “The Romans pressed on.’'—Per prae-
ceps, etc. “ Through the headlong column of terror-stricken fugi-
tives.’'-Subsidia. Not the reserves, but the strong bodies placed on
the flanks of the media acies, and therefore fai-ther beck than the
prominent part of the crescent.

24-33. Qui cuneus, etc. “And when the repulse of this crescent
had at first made the front even, and then caused a hollow in the
centre,” etc. —Affi circa. “The Africans around had already formed
wmgs,” i· Θ· ‚they had wheeled right and left so as to flank the sinus.
