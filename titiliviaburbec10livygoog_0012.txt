popularity to his connection with Livy rather than to any
merits of his own3 and a son, to whom he addressed a letter,
probably on rhetoric, in which he advised him to read Cicero
and Demosthenes, and those writers who most nearly resem-
bled Cicero and Demosthenes, That he enjoyed great fame
in his lifetime is 'clear from' the anecdote told by Pliny, that
a citizen of Gades came to Rome expressly to see Livy, and,
having scen him, immediately retu-med. He tells us himself
that he was acquainted wit-h Augustus, and Tacitus describes
this acquaintance as friendship, adding that it remained unim-
paired by the historiau's praises of Pompey. As all the anec-
dotes and criticisms quoted from Livy by Seneca and Quin-
tilian are connected with rhetoric, it is not unlikely that he
followed the profession of a rhetorician in Rome. We are
perhaps not justified in placing Claudius, who afterwards be-
came emperor, among the list of his pupils, but it was by his
advice that that unfortunate grandson of Livia devoted himself
to historica] writing. Livy died at Padua in the year 17 A.D.

Livy's works on philosophy, and his dialogues, which are
described by Seneca as 'partly philosophical and partly histor-
ical, are entirely lost3 and of his great work, originally consist-
ing of 150 books, extending to the death of Drusus, Ro. 9,
there only, remain thirty-five books and a few inconsiderable
fragments. These books are: the first decade, containing his
account of what happened from the founding of the city down
to the year 293 B.C.; the third and-fourth decades (embracing

the Second Punic War), from the year 218 Ro. to the year ·

182 B.C.; and five bookS‚ not quite perfect, of the fifth de‘
cade, ending 167 Re.- The contents of the lost books are
‚given in the so-called Epitomoe. These Epitomoe, or Periochoe
as they are named in some MSS„ seem to have been written
