well known. —Factiom‘s Bara‘noe opibus. ‘⁶ By the influence of the
Barcine party.” This party derived its name from Hamilcar, who
was surnamed Barca. They were opposed in the Senate by another
party, less hostile ω the Romans, the heads of which are here called
principes, “ the nobles. ”

18-26. Consilio. “ By stratagem.'’—Hospifiis reyahmm. ² “By
(forming) connectione of hospitality with the leading chieftains.” The
reguli here meant were the chiefs or heads of tribeS, to whom, on ac-
count of their inferior power, the appellation of reyes did uot properly
belong—Palam. According to Polybius (ii., 36), in the, night—time;

Edetani, in Hispania Tan-aconensis, near the sea, on an eminence on
the banks of the River Pallantias, between Sucro and Tarraco, and
nearly oue hundred miles to the south-west of the mouth of the Iberus,
When the Iberus therefore was made the boundary between the Car-

included in the former. According to Livy, however, it was expressly
stipulated in the treaty that the independence of Saguntum should be
preserved intact. Polybius, however, says nothing of this. The m‘ore
accurate view probably is that Saguntum had been for some time in
alliance with Rome, and therefore, though it was on the Carthaginian
side of the Iberus, was by Roman custom entitled to support.

do not agree in construction with what follows, Livy, no doubt,

or century to which it fell by lot to vote first in the Comitia. And
as their vote was regarded as an omen, and generally influenced the
votes of those that came after, proeroyativa came to signify a previous
