CHAPTER LIX.

2-14. Certamen mimorum. “ Animosity of feeling.'’—F'abium oon-
sulem habuisset. Compare chap. xliii. -Nec ante restitit quam . . .
vidit. In negative propositione Livy uses the indicative after ante
quam and μήπω quam, but in affirmative propositions the subjunctive.
-Tam expressa vis, etc. “ Then was forced out of them strength
(sufficient) for contending‚ in order that, ” etc„ i. e.‚ the obligation to
fight was wrung from them—Satis. “ Clearly enough.''—Alibi. “ In
other respecta.” We have given alibi with Weissenborn. Haupt's
conjecture, aliter, is also a good one. The MSS. have alii, which can--
not be correct, since by alii and miles Romanus the same persons must
be· meant.

16-24. Insuper. “ Still further.”—Ne utique expeffssss 0¹20· ‘⁸ By 1¹0
means to wish to make trial of his authority,” i. e.‚ to put his power
to the proof.—Vis omnis. “ The entire strength.'’— Vulqo. “ As a
general thing.”—Inqentis mali. “ Of a great disaster. '⁹

26-30. Quando quidem nihil, etc. “ Since they would gain nothing
except a delay of punishment.'’ This refers to what was passing in
the mind of Appius at the time. He knew that he could punish
them at some other time. obser-ve here the less usual meaning
of nom—Remissa. “ Having been given up. ''— Cum maxime, etc.
“ At the very time ¹in particular when,'’ ete—Novissime& “The
hindmost.”

33, 34. Ullius. For ullius alius rei. Compare chap. xlviii„ line 3.
-Per strayem corporum, etc. “ Over heaps of men and arms lying
strewed over the ground.'’ The majority of the men, of course, would
be, not the wounded or slain, but those who in their huri-y to escape
had flung away their armS, and were thrown down by coming into
oentact with one another.

36-43. O'um revocando, etc. “When he had in vain followed his
men in endeavoring to rally them. '’ Literally, “ to call them back.”
Another instance of the gerund with a meaning closely allied to that
of a present participle. Compare chap. xxxii„ line 16. —Haud fizlso.
“ Not without truth.”—Si9no amisso. In a collective sense—Dupli-
eam‘osque. ‘⁴ And the soldiers of double allowance.” The Duplicarii
(called also Duplavii) were soldiers who received on account of their
good conduct double allowance‚ and perham, in some casea, double
pay likewise.--Vir9is cassos, etc. Compare chap. v.‚ line {ih—Deci-
mus quisque. This is the famous punishment of decimation which
forms so marked a feature in the military discipline of Rome. It
does not appear to have been often inflicted in the early times of the
