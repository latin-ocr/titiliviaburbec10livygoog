'l'he senators were a select body of the populus or patriciana, which
acted as their representative. 'l'he second period above alluded to
extends from the close of the first down to the time of Constantine.
During this period the patricians were a real aristocracy of birth, and
as such formed a distinct class of Roman citizens, opposed to the ple-
beians, and afterwards to the new plebeian aristocracy of the nobles.
The third period extends from Constantine down to the Middle AgeS,
during which the patriciana were no longer au aristocracy of birth,
but were persons who merely enjoyed a title, first granted by the em·
perora, and afterwards by the popes also.

 

CHAPTER IX.

1-6. Jam. “ Already.” The particle indicates the rapid growth of
the city.—Sed penuria iudicium, etc. “ But through the scarcity of
women, its greatness was likely to last during one age of man merely, ’'
i. e.‚ during the then existing genemtion merely.—Spe⁸ proli-3, etc.

20, 21. Consualia. So called, according to Festus, Ovid, and oth-
ere, in honor of Consua, the god of secret deliberatione, but according
to Livy, in the present passage, celebrated in honor of Neptunus
Equestris. Plutarch, however, Dionysius of HalicarnassuS, and the
Pseudo-Asconius say that Neptunus Equestris and Consus tuere only
different names for the same deity. These gamos took place every
year on the 21st of August, and consisted of horse and chariot taces.-
—Quantoque apparatu, etc. “And they join in preparing their cele·
bration with as much pomp as they were then acquainted with, or
were able to employ.”
