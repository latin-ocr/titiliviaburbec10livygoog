306 · nome.

inde nome-n est. The dative, hy attraction‚ for the [more usual] nomi-
native, which latter occurs further on, in line 18, ‘⁶ Tran et huic lom
nomen est.’'—-Ab simili clade. “By reason of similar missor-tune.”
Observe here the employment of ab to denote a circumstance as the
calme of a thing. (Zumpt, ᾗ 305.)--Δ d majora rerum initia. Antenor
merely founded Patavium, but AEneas iu reality the Roman state.—
Primo in Macedoniam venisse. AEnea. (Αἴνεια), a town of Chalcidice
in Macedonia, was said to have been founded by Annona—Inde in
Siciliam, etc. The tradition current among the Greeks ascribed the
foundation of Segesta, in this island, to a band of Trojan settim-S,
fugitives from the destruction of their city3 and this tradition was
readily weleomed by the Romans, who in consequence claimed a kin-
dred origin with the Segestans.—Ab δίοἰὶἰα, etc. The prepositions

Laurentum, the ancient capital of Latium, and the residence of king
Latinus.

23-27. Dupkx indesama est. ‘⁴ From this point there is a. twofold
tradition.'' The first of these approximates to that which Vir-gil
giveS, the second to that mentioned by Dionysius of Halicarnassus
(i., 57, 64). Livy, however, sostens down the more marvellous feat-
ures of both. Compare virg„ AEn.‚ iii., 3893 vii„ 112.-Adfinitatem.
“ An alliance by marriage.''—Inter primores. ‘⁴ Among the foremost
ranks.'’ Compare chap. xii. t “Ense ad primores Romulus provolat ,··''

28—35. Unde aut quo casu, etc. “Whence (having come), or by
what casualty having departed from their home.”—Postquam audierit.
‘f After he heard (as is said).” Observe the employment of the sub-
