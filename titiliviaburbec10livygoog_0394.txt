“ Into his lodging-place,” Deversodum is properly an iun or lodging-

strange occurrence.”—-Illatam. “ Occasioned.‘' Literally, ‘² Brought
upon him.’'—Ab Turno dici sibi, etc. Hence Turnus, as plotting the

rum fuisse. “ That he was to have made the attempt.”-Auctor eou-
cilii. ‘⁴ The originator of the meeting,” i.e., the person who convened

ρεπεν-ε leti. It is called a novel mode of punishment because unusual
in historic times, being a remnant of early barbarism. Tacitus speaks
of it as being used by the ancient Gen-mans (Germ, xii.). ——Ad caput
aquoe Ferentinae. ‘⁴ At the head-waters of Ferentina.'’ The reference
is to a fountain‚ or rather lake, forming the head or source of the
