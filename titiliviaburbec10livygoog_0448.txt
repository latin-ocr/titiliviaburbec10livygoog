18-26. Relicta ab suis plebes. “ The portion os the commone lest
behind by their party.”—Raem‘dem. “who remained peaceably.”— ³
Νειίὶαυι profoeto spem reliquam ducere. ‘⁶ They considered no hope
assuredly left. ” Ducere is the historical infinitiva—Eam per sequa,
per iniqua, etc. “That that (unanimity) should be restored to the
state by fair means (or) by unfair,’' i. e., whether the demands of the
people were reasonable or aureasomble, they should be granted.—
Inds mitandum “Sprung from themselves.” As he bad been consul
(compare chap. xxi), aud as the consulship at this period was open
to the patriciana only, Crevier conjectures that on the mother’s side
he may have been of plebeian descent, though on the father’s patriciani,
or that he was one of those whom Brutus is said to have enrolled into
the Senate, i. e., the conscripti. Nino other depnties from the Senate
accompanied him. (Dicin, vi., 69.) Cicero, however, following a dif-
ferent account from Livy, makes the pacificator of the two orders to ¹
have been the dictator, M. Valerius (Brut, 143 compare Vah Max„ ⁴
viii„ 9, 1).

27-36. Ino-omem. “ Haring been admitted.”-Hon·ido. ‘⁶ Un-
polished.”—Non‚ ut amc, onmia, etc. “All the members did not agree
together, as they now do,” We have given here concutiebant, the
reading of Drakenborch and others. The manuscripts, however,
generally have ut nuuc οηιηία consentiant (the subjunctive in the obeua
oratio), which will require us to supply, rather awkwardly, the words
omnia consenserint after non—Suum consilinm. “Its own plan of ae-
tion.'’—Ministm·o. “ Sem-ice.''--Oonficerent. “Masticate it. ”--—Hac
ira. ‘⁸ That under the infl uence of this angry feeling.’'—Dum vellent.
The subjunctive in the obliqua oratio. There is no need, therefore,
of our changing dum to cum—Ad extrenum tabem. “ To the last de-
gree of emaciation.'’

38—41. Haud seyne. “No idle ποθ’-Μία) in omnes, etc.
“ Diffusing to all parts of the body this (our) blood, whereby we have
life aud strength distributed evenly through the veius, when brought
to maturity by the digestion of the food.’' More literally, “matun-ed
after the food has been digested.'’—00mparando hinc. “That, by
drawing a comptu-ison from this.”—Quam similis. “ How like. ’⁹
