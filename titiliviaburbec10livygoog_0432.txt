ceded by twenty-four lictors, and, as there was originally no appeal
from his sentence, his lictors bore the axes in the fasces eren in the
city, as a symbol of his absolute power over the lives of the citizens,
although, as we have already seen, by the Valerian law, the axes had

disappeared from the fasces of the consuls, Subsequently, however,
an appeal lay from their sentence to the people.--Dicto. “ His or-

This statement must, as Zumpt remarks, if we believe Livy’s own
declaration (chap. xviii.) that only men of consular rank were named
dictatore, be doubted. For A. Postumius was neither one os the con-
suls of the present year, nor had he ever borne the office before. It
would seem more correct, therefore, as the same editor remarks, to
follow those annalista who, as Livy tells us in chap. xxi„ assigned
the battle with the Latius at Lake Regillus to the third year after this·
