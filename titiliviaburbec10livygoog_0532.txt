28-32. Jovm. Here, of course, BaaL—In spem suam quisque aceep-
tis. The quiaque is to be taken strictly with auctoribus acceptis, and
the phrase regarded as equivalent to si deos auctora in spem suam
quisque accepisset. The ablativo absolute with a perfect participle
passive sometimes takes a word in apposition, as if the construction
were active, and contained a perfect participle active in the nominee
tive case. The Greek would be ὥσπερ τοὺς θεοὺς ἕκαστος τῆς ἐλπίδος
λαβόντες ἐγγυητάς. Compare bk. iv., chap. xliv„ “causa ipse pro
se dicta.'’ Niigelsbach, Stilistik, ξ 97, b.—Auctores. “SuretieS.''—
Sparata. Participle used substantively, like impedita in chap. xli„
line :za—Ad potienda. In classical Latin potior is followed by a gen-
itive or ablative3 but as it originally admitted an accusative, it is
used in the gerundivo like a common transitive verb, governing the
accusative. (Madvig, ς 265, obs. 2.)
