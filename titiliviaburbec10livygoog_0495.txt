Gartkayinem novam. Carthago Nova, now Carthayena, was situated
on the Mediterranean, about eqnidistant from Valencia on the east
and Malaga on the west, and was the capital of the Carthaginian
possessione in Spain. It was famed for its fine harbon-Stipendia
praeterito, “ Their back pay.’' The reference is literally to pay, the
time for discharging which has “gone by‚” and which remains still
due. Observa here the military meaning of stipendiumae— Vaccoeos.
The Vaccaei were a people in the interior of Hispania 'Pari-aconensis,
to the west of the Celtiberi. Their chief town was Palantia, now
Palencim to the north of the Durius, or Dour-o.

21-28. Ab Hermandica prosuyi. “Those who escaped from Her-
mandica.” Observe that pv=ofuqi‚ though an adJective, has here a kind
of substantive force—Carpetanos. The Carpetani were a powerful
people of Hispania Tarraconensis, on the rivers Anas and Tagus, in the
modern Castile and Estremadura. Their capital was Toletum, now
Teleda—Super ripam. The preposition super, with the accusative, an-
swers to both questions, whither ? and, where ἲ the latter in the present
instance. and hence is here the same as supra. (Zumpt, § 320.)—
C'um prima quiea, etc. “ As soon as there was the first sleep and
quietness on the side of the enemy.” For the force of ab here com-
pare Zumpt, ἓ 304, b.—leloque ita producto. “ And his rampart
having been extended only so far (towards the bank). ’' Observe the
force of ita. (Zumpt, § 726.) Hannibal did not bring down the ram-
part of his new encampment to the water’s edge, which he would have
done if his object merely had been to render his position more secure
in this quarter, but he wished to leave room for the enemy to cross
the river, in order to fall upon them with more advantage.

32-37. Appendicibns. “The additional forceS.’' Appendioes here·
imply minor forces added, by way of completion‚ to greater ones—-
Si oequo dimicaretur campo. “ If the battle had been fought on level
ground,” i. e., in the open plain. The imperfect subjunctive is em-
ployed here (where we use the pluperfect) by a lively and rhetorical
mode of expression, the past time being represented as present. The
regular form would have been dimicatum esset. (Zumpt, § 525.)—
Id morari victoriam, etc. “ Thinking that what of the river lay be-
tween (alone) delayed their victory,'’ i. e., that victory was only, de-
layed by the intervention of the nvem—Ullius. “ From any one.‘”
Taken substantively. “

38-48. Et ea: parte altera. Observa the employment of et for etiam.
(Zumpt, ᾗ 335.)-Ι1ηηιίεεα. By Hannibal. — Quippe ubi. “Since
there. ”—Instabilia “ Not having a sure footing.”—-Equo temere acto.
“ His horse being merely impelled at 1=andom,'’ i. e., without singling
out any one of the foe, but merely driving right συνετὰ-Εὕαν.
