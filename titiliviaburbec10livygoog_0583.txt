ΒΚ. xx11., CHAPS.XLVI11,XLIX. 573

-Romania The Romans had advanced densa acie, with hastati prin-
cipes and triarii all close together3 and seem, as the line of Gauls
gave way, to have in their eagerness extended themselves into a
wedge.—Comua. The extremities of the wings.-Desuncti. “Hav-
ing fruitlessly finished one engagement.’'-Et . . . inteqram. Inte·-
9ram is added to show that this new engagement was not affected by
the former struggle: it was a fresh and independent light—Recenti·
bus. “ Fresh in spi1·its.”— Veyetis. “ Fresh iu body.'’

 

CHAPTER. XLVIII.

4-13. Quinqmtvz etc. This stratagem is not mentioned by Polyb-
ius-Numidae. In bk. xxv„ chap. xi.‚ the Numidians are described
as unarmed except with jevenas—In mediam acvkm. The centre,
where the infantry was stationed. -Ee dum, etc. Livy conceives the
pretended desei-tion of the Numidians to have taken place at the be-
ginning of the battle—Sentis. The shields of the Roman infantry,
not their own parmae. —- Aversam, etc. “ The rear of the Roman
line. ’²

16-18. Pertinax in mala jam ᾦα. “Maintained with the obstinacy
of despair. ” The words in mala &express the condition of pertinax.
—Ea parte. “ On that wing.” asdrubal, after routing the right
wing of the Romans, had passed over to the Carthaginian right wing,
where Maharbal was in command. Being victorious here, τοο, he
sends in pursuit the Numidians who had been diverting the attention
of the enemy, and falls with his Spanish and Gallie troopers on the
rear of the Roman infantry, already suffering from the fiank attack of

the Ati-ician infantry. Praeest is used here absolutely. “ Held the
eomman .''

Κ CHAPTER XLIX.

1-10. Parte altera. The two wings being utterly defeated, the een-
tre was the only part now left. Paulus at first commanded the right.
—Equitibus Romanis. His mounted body-guard. Compare bk. ii.,
chap. xx„ line 14, “Dekcta neantes praesidii cansa.''—Defioekbant.
‘⁴ Began to fail.''—Quam mallem, etc. Ironical. “How 1 should
prefer he handed them over in chains.'' Plutarch gives Hannibal's
words: “ 1 should prefer this to having them handed over in chains.’'

 

11-15. Quale. The verb is omitted. “ Such as one might expect
when the victory of the enemy was no longer doubtful.'’—Duln‘a vic-
toria. Ablative absolute—Cum victi. ‘⁴ Seeing that the conquered,'¹
