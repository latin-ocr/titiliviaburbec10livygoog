8-1‘2. E.rplicandi ordines. 'rhe MS. reading is ordinib, which would
refer merely to a single rank, not to an entire army. , We have given
therefore the correction of Gronovius Drakenborch conjectures ex-
plicandis welintona—A bjectis temere meeis, etc. “ Having been rather
thr-own off at random than hurled with any aim (at the foe).'’—In
uranus . . . ad qladios. Livy is fond of varying his expressione, par-
ticularly prepositionS.—Genus Fabium. Equivalent to qens Fabia.
Zumpt, however, thinks that qens would refer merely to the patriciam-0,
whereas yenus includes also the humbler families of the same name
attached to the great house, freedmen and their descendants.

14-28. Pn‘ncipem in consertos Veientes. ‘⁴ Foremost into the thick·
est of the Veiente8.'’—Armornm arte. “ Skill iu arms. ’'— Versantem.
“ Ranging.” Moving to and fro—Telo extracto. etc. ‘⁴ The weapon
having been plucked out (by the Tuscan), Fabius fell headlong on the
wound,” i. e.‚ fell foi-ward on his breast where he 'had received the
wound. The word abiit. says Burmann (ad Quinctil. Declam„ 9, 5),
is expressive· of the force and quickness with which he fest—Hoc ju-
rastis? “Was it this which you swore ?”—Injuratus. Dionysius
(ix, p. 567) says, on the contrary, that the consuls did take the
oath.—Te impetraturum. “ That you will bring it to pase.''—In pri-
mum, “ To the van.'’—Insensis hastis. The term infestus is more
commonly applied to weapons and things, and intensus to persons.

 

OHAPTER. XLVII.

3-12. Est versata. “Prevailed.”—Et ut ille. “And when he,'‘
i. e.‚ Manlius.—Gradmn rettulere. “They fell back,'’ i. e.‚ from the
point to which they had advanced.— cessissentque loco. , “ And would
have retired from the field.” Literally, “from the place ’' originally
assigned them in the commencement of the fight.—Rem inclinatam.
‘⁴ The drooping action.’' Inclinatam properly means here “ beut,'' or
“ turned away, ” for the purpose of flight, the latter, however, not
having as yet actually commenced.

13-22. Coram. ‘⁸ In person.”— Vanior. “Thinner,” i.e.‚ full of
gupa. Equivalent to rarior, and opposed to densa acies. The primary
signification of vanus is “empty.''—Subtracta subsidia. “Detached
bodies of reserve.’'—Terunt. Some read tererent, which is incorrect.
oum tererent would be correct—Nuntii& “ Intelligence.” Nuntius,
like the Greek ἅγγελος, has the double meaning of “ messenger,” and
of “the message'’ sent—Ad praetorium. “To the general's tent, ”
i. e.‚ to the quai-ter where the general’s tent was, The commender
of an army was originally called praetor, i. e.‚ qui praeite—Opposita
“Having been posted.”
