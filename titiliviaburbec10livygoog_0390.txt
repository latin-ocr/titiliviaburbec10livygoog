occupasse. “ lie had usurped.” Observe the force os the verb here,
implying that he had, in seizing upon the throne, anticipated all legal
and constitutione} neeges— 3.ϊ quo ipse sit. The subjunctive here
marks the sentiments of the speaker, thus becoming what may be
termed the mood of quotation-Odia alienoe honestatis. “Through
hatred of the nobility os others,’' i. e.‚ their high rank by birth.—
