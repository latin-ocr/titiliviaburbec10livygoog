their conduct, to their regard for good saith aud the obligation of an
oath. Muretus, however, disliking the manuscript reading, which is
the one we have followed, conjectures prox-ime leyum ac poenarum me-
tum, “like the sear of laws and punishments 3²² and several editors,
Zumpt among the number, have inadvertently adopted it. [Seeley
translatae, “ A sear scarcely less effective than that inspired by laws ;”
taking the phrase as equivalent to metu proximo metum layum. Mad-
vig conjectures pro obnoxia]

8-16. Cum {psi se Homines, etc. “ Since the people were moulding
themselves after the moral principles of the king as the only (true)
model,’' etc. Observe the employment here of cum with the subjunc-
tive formarent, as indicating the cause or reason of what is stated in
the succeeding clause—Ad sollicitandam omnium paoem. “ For the
purpose of disturbing the {eneraln peace.''—In eam verecundiam. ‘⁴ To
that feeling of respect (for hem)’ '—Ex opaco specu. ‘⁴ Issuing from
a dark recess, ’' The spot referred to iu the text, where Numa was
believed to have had his interviews with Egeria, was near the city, at
the Porta Capena, in the valley now called caparam, and where the
sacred - shield had fallen from heaven. There was also another spot
sacred to Egeria near Annia—Camenis. The Camenae, of whom
Egeria was one, were Roman divinities, whose name is connected
with carmen (an oracle or prophecy), whence we also find the forms
casmenae, Gamenae, and Carmentis. The Camenae were accordingly
prophetie nymphe, and they belonged to the religion of ancient Italy,
although later traditione represent them as having been introduced into
Italy from Arcadia. The Roman poete, however, eveh as early as the
time of Livius Andronicum, apply the name of Camenae to the Muses.

18-22. Soli Fidei. “To Faith alone,” i. e.‚ separately, or in her
sole honor. The epithet soli, however, is an extremely awkward one
here, and has probably arisen from some corruption of the text.
Dionysius (ii., 75) makes mention of a temple of Public Faith built by
Numa on the Capitoline (ἱερὸν Πίστεως δημοσίας), and the same deity
must here be meant—Samarium. The idea of a temple is already
implied in sollemne.-Bt‘9is, curru arcuato, “In a two-horse ehariot,
with an arched roof.” Compare Weissenborn3 ‘⁶ bogenformig ge-
wolbt.” Over the chariot a covering was also thrown. The whole
was symbolical of the seerecy connected with good faith.—Tutandam.
“Ought to be protected.’'—Quae. Not quos. (Zumpt, ἓ 372.)—Aryeos.
“Argei” Varro calls them the chapels of the Argei, and says they
were twenty-seven in number, distributed in the different districts of
the city. We know but little of the particular uses to which they
were applied, and that little is unimportant. They would appear to
have had something to do with the old rites of the Pelasgi, with
whom the name of Argos was connected.
