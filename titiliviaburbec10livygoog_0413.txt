CHAPTER IV.

' 1⁴8. Vitelliis. The patrician house of the Vitellii (in place of
whom Dionysius has the Gellii) appears to have died out with the in·-
dividuals here mentioned. The Aquilii, however, are spoken of at a
later period. Compare chap. xl„ line 51. The Aquilii mentioned
in the text were born of a sister of CollatinuS.—Adolescmtes liberi.
“ Sons grown up to manhood.”—In societatem consilii. “Into a par-
ticipation in the plot. '’— Conscit'. ‘⁴ As accomplice8.''—Ab2‘it. “ Has
perished.'' Inter-iit and intercidit are more usual in' this sense.

8-16. In senatu. The decision of the Comitia Ota-iata (Dionys,
τι, 6) is passed over by Livy in silence—Quae censebat. ‘⁶ Which rec-
ommended.-’'——C'ausam. ‘⁴ As a pretext.”—Sumpsissent. ‘⁶ They had
obtained. '’-Evincuntque instando. “ And gain their point by urging.”
-Nam aliter, qui ‹tv-edituros eos, etc. ‘⁴ For otherwise how would they
(the Tarquins) believe that false tidings were not communicated (to
them) respecting affairs of so much importance P'* Observe that qm·
is here the ablative. The employment of super for de is confined al·
most entirely, as Zumpt remarks, to writers of the ‘silver age—Mani-
festum facinus fecerunt. “ Made the treason palpable.” .,

17-27. Coenatum sorte, etc. “They had chanced to sup at the house
of the Vitellii.'’ The commone text has et before caenatum, but strict
Latinity is against making qne follow et, and we have accordingly
thrown it out. -Evcepia “ Ove1·heard.’' More literally, “ Caught
np.’'—-Rem coaryuere possent. “Might be able to prove clearly the
whole affair.'’-Ne interciderent. ‘⁴ Lest they should escape their
hande.'' More literally, “ Fau between (their fingere).''—C'ommicisse,
at hostium Iocc essent. “To have so far committed themselve5‚ that
they should be (regarded) in the light of open enemies'‚ yet the law of
nations prevailed,” i. e., the internetionnl law, which rendere inviolate
the persons of ambassadorS.

CHAPTER. V.

2-4. Res inteyra reserffur ad patres. ‘⁴ The whole subJect is laid
again before the father3.”-In publicum rediyi. “ To be convert-ed into
public property.’' Supply aerariwn with publicum. That ie, to be sold,
and the proceeds of the sale to be paid into the public treasury.-—
Diripimdc‘z. “ To be plundered.”— Contacta reyia praeda. “ Being in-
fected by the royal plunder‚” i. e., polluted, as it were, and rendered
criminal in the eyes of the king by their plundering his property.
