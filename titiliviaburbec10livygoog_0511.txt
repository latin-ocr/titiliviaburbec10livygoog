Pedites cetratos. “ Targeteers.” More literally, “ foot soldiers armed
with-theram. ” The cetra was a small round shield, made of the hide
of a quadruped. It appears to have been identical with the targe of
the modern Scottish HighlanderS.-—F'unditores Baleares. “ Balearic
elingers.” The inhabitants of the Balearic I 'ands (Majorca and Mi-
norca) were famed for their skill with the ’ng.—-Per Africam. In

CHAPTER XXII.

1-12. Atque td eo minus. “And the less on this account.’' The
MSS. give haud before minas, which we have omitted with Bekker,
and which had been previously condemned by Gronovius, They also
read ideo for td eo. If the MS. reading be retained, the meaning will
be, “And that it was therefore not less to be cared for”-the positive
curandam being mentally supplied from the preceding non neqlv’qendam.
But this makes the proximity of the second haud in the succeeding
clause extremely inelegant.—-C'ircamitam. „Spain lying to the west of
the Iberus is meant. Compare chap. xff.,1ine 21. —Quinyentia This
and quinquaqinta farther on are wanting in the MSS, and are supplied ’
from the narrative of Polybius (iii., 33). —Libypkoenicea Those sub-
jects of Carthage whe had sprung from marriages between the rm-
migrant Phoenicians nd native Africans, They ranked next to the
Carthaginians proper, the ruling Phoenician citizens of the capital.—
Numidoe. Between the territory of Carthage and Mauretania. Their
country formed the largest portion of the modern Alyeria.—1Maan'.'
Between Numidia and the coast of the Atlantic. Their country cor-
responds to the modern Fez and Moroem.—Ad mila octinyenti. Ob-
serve that ad is here an adverb, with the force of circiter, and governs
no case. (Zumpt, ἓ 296.)—Iler9etam. The Ilergetes were situated
between the Iberus and the PyreneeS, in the modern Catalom‘a. Their
capital was Ilerda, now Lerida.

15-18. Qua parte· belli. Observe that parte here indicates the‘ ‘’'mode
or‘ ‘manner, ”and' compare note on chap. xvii„ line 23. —Viceranu
Scil. Romani. —Oredi poterat. “It might be supposed.' ⁹-Aptoe in-
structoeqae remiin. “Were fitted out, and manned with rowe1 e.
Observe that remiyio is put here sor remiqihus, the abstract for the
concrete. — Triqinta et ἀνω. “ Only thirty-tWO.” Supply solam.
Only a part of the fleet left to Hasdrubal was fitted out and manned.

Σ 21-33. Etovissam urbem. What city is meant cannot be determined3
