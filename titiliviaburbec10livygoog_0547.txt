CHAPTER. V.

1-6. Ut in re trepida. “ Considering the confusion.”— Ver-teme se
quoque. ‘⁶ As each turned at the varied shouts ;'’ quoque is ablativo
of quisque—Nec enim . . . periculi esse. Oratio obliqua without the in-
troductory word of saying.

11-17. Tantam aberat ut. In this phrase abest is impersonal. (Mad-
vig, ᾖ 440, Obs, 1.)-Siyna denotes the maniple; ordines, the centu-
ry3 locum, the place in the πώεα-Διί yemitus. “At the g1·oans,’'
i. e., on hearing, etc.-Vulnemm. ‘⁴ On account of, or caused by the
wounds.” A very free use of the genitive3 or, vulnerum may be the
abstract for the concrete, “wounded.‘’-Strepentium paventiumque.
‘⁴ Of the shouting assailants and the terror-striqken defendere.''

20-30. Impetus capti, notsacti‚· because a special exet-tion is meant.
“ Charges were hurriedly and desperately made.'’-— Claudebat. The
imperfect, as the tense of confimmnce, between the perfects capti and
apparuit. “ Were still confining them.”—De inteyro. “Afresh.'’
—Non illa ordinata. “ Not that well-known duly arranged.'’—Prin-
cipes, hastati, triarii. The army was formed in three linea, the hastati
in the first, the principes in the second, the triarii in the third line.
Livy puts the principes first, because that was their position when a
battle was recommenced after the defeat of the first line of hastati.—
cohorte. A tenth part of a legion, consisting of three manipuli.—
E'um motum teme. The story of the earthquake “ that reeled unheed-
edly away ” is from Caelius Antipater. As the names of the cities
overthrown by it are not given, we have no means ofjudging whether
the line of the shock was likely to pass through the Trasimene lake.

 

CHAPTER VI.

3-16. Robora virorum. “ Picked troops.”--Insaber. One of the
Gallie tribe which Flaminius had conquered in his first consulship.—
Ducario. “ His name was Ducariusss’ In the expression . . . nomen
est, the name itself may stand either in the nominative in apposition
to nomen, or in the dative by attraction, as is more often the case.
Here supply ‹et—Manibus. “ To the Mane3.”-—Inflesto. Infestus im-
plies hostile attack, infensus hostile disposition.-.'l'riavii. “ Some
triarii.”

18—33. Per omnia arta, etc. Compare bk. xxi„ chap. xxxii„ line 31 ε
“per confrayosa omnia.” ‘⁴ Through nothing but defiles and precipices.”
—Fuere quos . . . impulerit. The characteristic relative3 for the moed,
see Madvig, § 365.—Gapessere. Infinitive after impulerit, a poetical
