CHAPTER XVIII.

1-8. Omnia jasta,fierent. “All just formalities might be observed,’¹
i. e., all the formalities established by law or eunom—Q. Fabium.
Fabius Cunctator. —M. Livium, L. AEmilium. The consuls of the
previous year.—Boebium. He had been sent before (chap. vi.) as an
ambassador to Hannibal and to Carthage.-Pablico consilio. “By
public resolve.''—Id quod facturi videbantur. “ What they appeared
likely to do.”—Ac defenderent. ‘⁶ And should state, in defence (of the
conduct of Hannibal).”—- Ut indicerent, etc. Observe the change of
construction, where we should expect ad indicendum bellum.

11-20. Unum, quod ‘mandatum erat. “The one thing which had
been given them in charge.”—Praeoeps vestra, etc. ‘⁴ Even your
former embassy, Ο Romane, was a precipitato one.” They had
then demanded the sul-render of Hanniba13 and now they made the
question of peace or war to turn upon the simple fact of Hannibal’s
being publicly authorized to act as he had done, without allowing any
justification or exculpatory statement on the part of Carthage.-Ce-
terum hoec quatio. “Your present embassy however.'’ Observe the '
force of ceterum. Your present embassy is like the former, with this
point of difference‚ however, ete-Adhuc. “ As yet, ’' i. e., as far as
you have yet spoken—Exprimitur. ‘⁶ Is sought to be extorted.”- Ut
a confessis. “As from those who have confessed,” i. e., as though
we had confessed. An imitation of the Greek construction of ὡς with
a participle. (Matth., Gk. Gr„ ἓ 568.)-Oenseam. ‘⁶ Am inclined to
think. ” Observe the ironical employment of the subjunctive.

21-26. Quaestio atque animadversio. “ Inquiry into the conduct of,
and also inflicting of punishment upon.'’—Quid nostro, etc. The
common text omits quid—Disceptatio. ‘⁴ Point of discussion.”—Per
foedus. “ As far as the treatfi'sfconcernedss’ (Madvig, ἓ 255, Obs. ·
1 3 Zumpt, ᾗ 301, extr.)—F'oedus est. ‘⁴ There is a treaty (let me tell
you).'’ Observe the omission of the apodosis here after the protasis
with quoniam. (Zumpt, ᾗ 772.) This is often done in an animated
speech or narrative—Cum caveretur, etc. “ Though provision was
made for the allies of both parties.” Observe the construction of
caveo. Thus caveo te, “ 1 avoid thee ;” but caveo tibi, ‘⁴ I provide for
thy safety,’' etc. (Zumpt, ς 414.)

28-33. Aa enim. “ But then (it may be alleged in reply).’' Com-
pare the Greek ἀλλὰ γάρ, and consult Zumpt, ἓ 349. Used very often
in anticipating an objection on the part of another, and hence em·-
ployed by Livy only in speeches‚ never in a running narrative.—Ex- ’
cipiantur. ‘⁴ Are specinlly excepted,” i. e.‚ there is a special clause in
their favor, by which their snfety is guaranteed against any attacks
