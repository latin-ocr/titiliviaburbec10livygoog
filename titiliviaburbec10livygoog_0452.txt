CHAPTER XXXV.

1-10. Nimis atrox. ‘⁴ Too harsh.”--Et plebem ira prope annae-it.
“ And almost drove the Commons to arms through exasperation..”—
Sc jam peti. “That they are now being assailed.”- Victu. “ Sus-
tenance.”—Satisfiat. ‘⁸ satisfaction be taken.’' The surrender of
the tribunes, their only protectore, would lead to the infliction of pun-
ishment on the backs of the Roman populace—Eam sibi carnificem,
etc. “That he had started up as a new executioner for them.'’ · Co-
riolanus is meant. —Dc‘em dixissem. “Appointed a day of trial for
blm.” Diem dicem is a legul form of expression, and means to give
notice that on a certain day a certain individua-l will be brought to
trial. The accused, in the mean time, was compelled to give security
for his appearance on the day appointed. If such security was not
given, he was kept in confinement.

11-18. Ibt. “ Thereupon.’'—Aaxilii non poenoe. “ of lending aid,
not of inflicting punishment.” Consult note on chap. xxxiii„ line 3.
—Potestati. “ Office.”— Ut unius poena, etc. “ 'rhat the fathers had
to get off by the punishment of one individual‚” i. e.‚ had to escape
danger themselves by giving up one of their own number to punish-
ment. The verb is here taken impersonally.—Restiterunt tamen, etc.
“ They made a stand, however, though popular hatred stared them in
the sace ;'’ i. e.‚ though they thereby exposed themselves to the ha-
tred of the populace. Observe that adversa invidia is the ablativo

absolute. - Qua . . . qua. “As well . . . as,” Taken adverbially.
But strictly parte is understood..

19-22. clientibus. The clientes, dependent as they were on their
patroni, the patricianS, had, until the period of the Twelve TableS,
other interests than those of the free plebs, and often stood arrayed
against the latter, and on the side of the patriciana—Dqu'ioere retu.
‘⁶ Το qnash the whole affair. ''— Universi. “They all in a body.”—
Quae‘dqm'd erat patrum, etc. “You would have said that whatever
there was of fathers were under impeachment,’' i. e.‚ that all the fa-
thers were accused of treason‚ and endeavoring to excite eompassi0n‚
and not one of their order merely. On these occasions the individ-
uals who went around to solicit the people either for themselves or
for others usually arrayed themselves in mouming.—-Unum sibi ci-
vem, etc. “That‚ if they were unwilling to aequit him as innocent,
they would (at least) pardon unto them, as guilty, one citizen, one
senator, ” i. e.‚ pardon for their makes, out of regard for them. More

ὶίιξὲῑῐζὲίἔι, “yvould make his pardon, as a guilty man, a present. to
ves. ’

24-28. Damnatus. Dionysius and Plutarch say that this sentence
