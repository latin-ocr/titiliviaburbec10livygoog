therefore, proposoe to read priris but the term is too unusual a one.
11 is possible that Hannibal, finding Alco so averse to the original
tenus, permitted Alorcus to propose less rigid conditions. Doring,

sione. “ A withdrawal.'’-Semet ipsi. Stress laid on the subject, and
hence ipsi. not ipsos. (Zumpt, ἓ 696.)-Ραι·ω· ac trepidatio, “ The
dismay and agitation.” Trepidatio properly denotes a state of eon-
fused hurry or alarrn, a running to and fra—Per ηιὲπαηι. “ Through
the breach.” The singular here is unusual in this sense—Onna siq-
mmr imperatori dedisset. etc. They gare a signal that, so far as could
be seen from their lofty position in the citadel‚ the lower part of the city

torian Polybius.—H2·bema. He allowed the whole of the winter for
his troops to rest. -Fieri non potuit, etc. Livy's reasoning is correct.
Saguntum must have been taken towards the beginning of Bc, 218,
when Scipio and Sempronius were consulit, the year in which the
battle of Trebia was fought. Compare notes on chap. vi.—Nam esc-
ceseisse‚ etc. “For the battle at the Trebia cannot have reached into
the year, ” etc.‚ i. e., cannot have belonged to or fallen in it. This
would make the battle in question to have been fought, not in B.C.
