usually placed at the head of the Roman annalista But there were
composers of poetic legende οι· lays before his time. He served in
the Gallie war, B.C. 225, and also in the second Punic War. He
wrote in Greek. (Dionys, i.‚ 6.) His work appears to have been one
of great velue, although Polybius charges him with great partiality
towards the Romane, and both this writer and Dionysius speak of him
as frequently inconsistent and inaccurate. A few fragments alone
remain.-Arma ferre possent. That is, according to the regulation
of Servius—Amet Esquiliae. The employment of auget here points
to the fact that a part of this hill was already inhabited, and that it
merely received a fuller population under Servius There is no need,
therefore, of Gronovius’s emendation of Esquiliis in the ablative.

15-19. Ayyere ct fossis et muro, etc. For an account'of the walls
and circuit of the city under Servius Tulliae, consult the article
‘⁶ Ronm‚'' in Smith’s Dict. Gemma—Ita pomoerium profert. “Thus he
enlm-ges the pomoerium.'’ Literally, ‘⁶ carries it forward.”—-Postmoe-
rium. Thetis, post murum, or a space behind the wan—Circa marum.
‘⁴ On both sides of the wall.”— Certis circa terminis. “ With distinct
landmarks on both side8.” These termini were stone pillau-S, called by
Varro Gippi pomoerii (L. L„ w, 143, Miiller), and were erected at cer-
tain intervals.

20-27. Ut neque interiore parte, etc. ⁸* So that the houses might
neither be erected close to the walle, whereas now in general they
even unite with them.'’ That is, the city wall forms now the back
of the house. ——Non mayis quod post murum esset, etc. ‘⁴ Not more
because it was behind the wall than because the wall was behind it.’'
-Prqferebantan ‘⁶ Were carried forward.’'

 

CHAPTER XLV.

1-6, Maynitudine. “By the enlargement.”—Fomnat2‘8. “ Having ’
been modelled.'’— Consilio. “ By policy.”—D1'anoe Ephesiae. The
Ephesian Diana, or ArtemiS, was a divinity totally distinct from the
Greek goddess of the same name. She seems to have been the per-
sonification of the fructifying and all-nourishing powers of nature.
It is an opinion almost universally adopted that she was an ancient
Asiatic divinity, whose worship the Greeks found established in Ionia
when they settled there, and that, for some resemblance which they
discovered, they applied to her the name of Artemis—A civitatibus
Asiae. By Asia is here meant Asia Minor, and more particularly the
Greek portion of it along-the coast.

7-15. Eum consensum, etc. “ Such unanimity and allied gods,’‘
