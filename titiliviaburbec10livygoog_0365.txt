supine. Observe here the force of the preposition a, “ on thess'ide

29-37. Rebus auctis. “The state being augmented.”--Discrimine
recte an perperam, etc. “The distinction of right and wrong being
confounded.’' Literally, “of a thing done rightly -or wrongly.”—-
Carcer. This was what was called the Carcer Mamertinus, and from
the language of the text would seem to have been more a place of
punishment than of mere imprisonment. It is still to be seen near
the arch of SeveruS, under the church of S. Giuseppe dei Fakynami.
——Silva Maesia. Situated probably on the right bank of the Tiber,
between Rome and the sea-coast. Pliny notices it as abeunding in
dormice (H. N„ viii„ 58, 83, § 225).——Ostia. Dei-iring its name from
its situation at the mouth of the river. It was sixteen miles distant
from Rome—Salinae. These salt—works for a long time continued to
supply both Rome ’itself and the neighboring country in the interior
with that necessary article. —AEdes Jovis Feretrii. Compare chap. x.

1—4. Lucumo. In Etrurian Lambrus, to which the contracted Latin
form Lacmo closely correspondS. Livy mist-ekes it for a proper name;
but the term is said to have meant in Etrurian ‘⁴ a chief‚” or “noble,”
and to have been employed to designate &member of the ruling caste,
or aristocracy, in whose hands lay all the power of the nation. So
that it would be thus analogous to the Roman term “patriciam” in
its earliest sense. The individna1‚ therefore, referred to in the text
was not, as Livy makes him, named “ Lucum0‚'' but was one of the
chiefs or nobles in the Etrurian city whence he came; in other wordS,
he was a Lucumo or Lauclzme. · (Niebuhr, H. R„ vol. i.‚ p. 123.)—
Tarqm‘uiis. Tarquinii was one of the oldest and most important cities
of Etruria, situated about four miles from the coast of the lower sea,
and fourteen miles from Centumcellae, or the modern civita Vecchia.
It was the metropolis of the twelve cities which composed the Etrus-
can league, just as Alba was represented as the metropolis of the
Latin league.

5-9. Demarati Corinthii filius erat. This Greek origin of the Tar·-
qnin family is purely fabulous. The story of the Tarquins has evi-
dently been drawn from the works of several popular poem, and there
can be little doubt that one at least of these writers must have become
acquainted with Greek literature and history from the Greek colonies
in Southern Italy. Hence the Corinthian or Grecian feature in the
present legend. Demaratus was a merchant—noble of Corinth, and
one of the Bacchiadae. He fied from Corinth when the power of his
