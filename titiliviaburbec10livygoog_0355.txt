in the oblique cases Anienis, etc. Dionysius uses Ἀνίης, -ητος,.-Λι1
confluentes. “ At the confluence of the riverS.” Supply amnes. The
Anio and Tiber are meant. —Et in acie. ‘⁴ In the line of battle als0.”
The et implies that the Veientes„ as in crossing the 'l'iber they had
Fidenae on their left, so were they similarly marshalled in the battle-
field als0, since the Fidenates occupied the left wing. —Albano non plus
animi, etc. “ The Alban had not more courage than fidelity.’'—Suc-
cedit. “Moves upward.’' Compare the phraseS, succedere tumulum,
succedere muros, ete—Ubi satis subisse sese ratus est. “ When he
thought that he had ascended far enough‚'' i. e., not to be pai-saed.—
Eriqit totam aciem. ‘⁴ He halts liis whole army.” Crevier compares
with this the French faire alte, or formerly haut, because soldiers then
ὓ stand upright, and hold their spears ereet. The common but errone-
ous translation of the present clause is, ‘⁴ He marches his whole army
up.'’‘ Hunter‚ who advocates it, has a most unfortunate note on the
subject. He supposes that Mettius himself first withdrew to a rising
ground (sensim succedit), and when he had himself gained a sufficient
height he made his whole army also march up!

24-32. Qua. “ In whatsoever direction,’' i. e., on whatsoever side.
—Rem ‘⁶ The decision of the affair.”—Inclinare vires. ‘⁴ To bend
his strength.”—Esse. Historieal infinitive, for erat—Salios These
were called Salii Οοίἰίπί, A qonales. or Ayonenses, because they performed
their ceremonias and had· their chapel on the Colline hill (the same as
the Quirinal, or at least a part of it), previously called the Agonal hill.
The Salii instituted by Numa, who were different from these, were
called Palatini, because they performed their ceremonies aud had
their chapel on the Palatina hist-Eidem imperat. The ordinary
reading is idem, referring to the king. We have preferred, however,
. the conjecture of Gronovius, eidem, as referring to the horseman.

35-45. Id rati. “Haring supposed that to be the case.”-Et au-
diverant, ete. “ The Fidenates had both heard what was -thus spoken
with a loud voice, and a large portion of them understood Latin, since
they had been added as colonists unto the Roman8,‘' i. e., had become
intermingled with Romans in the colony—Decursis. “By a sudden
descent.''—Intercluderentur. The battle was fought to the south of
Fidenae, so that they could have been cut off by the Albans.-Ab effusa
fuya. The river prevented them from flying in disorder3- it was so
close to them that they bad not time to scatter3 but still their-ssight
led to it.—Inter fuqae puynoeque consilium. That is, while wavering

between the resolution whether to fight or fiee. ,-
