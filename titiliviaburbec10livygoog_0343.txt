ties, remained from that time unaltered. —Et yentz’ conditoris, etc.
“ And not foreign to the family of the founder (of Rome).'' Rea
Silvia, the mother of Romulae, was a Vestal.—Adsiduoe templi antis-
tites· Their chief office was to watch, by turns, day and night, the
everlasting fire that blazed upon the altar of Vesta. [Stipendium de
publico. The Vestals were endowed with part of the ayer publicus]

14-18. Salios. The name is commonly derived from salio, and
hence means properly the Leapers or JumperS. The Salii were
chosen from the patricians even in the latest timeS, and formed an
ecclesiastical corporation. Tullus Hostilius established another col-
legium of Salii in fulfilment of a vow which he made in a war with
the SabineS. Compare chapter xxvii—Marti Gradive. “ For Mars
Gradivu8,” i. e., the striding or marching, and derived from yradior.
Soldiers, when they marched out, sometimes halted near his temple,
which stood outside the Porta Capena, on the Appian way—Tunicae
pictae. “‘Of an embroidered tunic.’' This was bound with a brazen
belt, or, as Livy terms it, oeneum pectori teyumen, “ a brazen covering
for the breast.’'—Ancilia. These were the sacred shields‚ of an oval
form, but with the two sides receding inwards with an even curva—
ture, so as to make them broader at the ends than in the middle.
According to the legend, one anci-le fell from heaven in the reign of
Numa, when the Roman people labored under a pestilence. And as
upon the preservation of this shield depended the fate of Rome, Numa
caused eleven others of the same size and form to be made, that if
ever any attempt was made to carry away the true one, the plunderer
might find it difficult to distinguish this from the resa—Ac per urbem
ire. This took place on the first of March, the festival of Mars, and
also for several successive days, At the conclusion of the celebration
the Salii were accustomed to partake of a splendid entertainment in
the temple of Mars—Carmina. These songs or hymns were called
Asamenta, Assamenta, or Axamenta, and in later times were scarcely
understood by the priests themselves—Cum tripudiis, etc. In the
dance they struck the shields with rods, so as to keep time with their
voices and with the movements of the feet.

18-22. Pontificem, “As chief pontiff.'’ The Pontifex Maximus
is meant here3 for there were four pontifices at first created, whose
number was afterwards increased.—Numam Marcium. He had accom-
panied Numa. from the Sabine country to Rome. It is said that he
aspired to the kingly office on the death of Numa, and that he starved
himself to death on the election of Tullus Hostilius, His son, also
called Numa MarciuS‚ married the daughter of Numa Pompilius, and
became the father of Ancus Mai-cim, the fourth king of Rome. He
was made Praefectus urbis by Tullus Hostilius. Most editors of Livy
'confound the son with the father, making the latter to have been
