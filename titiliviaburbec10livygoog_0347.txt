CHAPTER XXIII.

1 -1 Ο. Haec nuntiant do‘nzum. “ Carry these tidings home.”—Troja-
nam utramque probem. ‘⁶ Both being Trojan offspiing,'’ i. e.‚ of Tro-
Jan descent. Observe that prolem is in apposition with natos—Minus
miserabilem. “ Less deplorable.''—- Consu-si sunt. “ Were merged.’'

,13-16. Fossa Cluilii. Niebuhr makes this to have been near Serte-
bassi, between the fourth and fifth mile-stones from the Porta Capena,
on the road to Frascati. He thinks the name of the ditch was un-
questionably derived from an Alban prince. Weissenborn, on the
other hand, makes the ditch to have been an outlet of the Alban lake,
and' he connects the name with cluere, and κλύζειν, i. e.‚ pur-qam.—
Abolevit. “ Has become forgotten.’' Taken intransitively.—Albani.
Not the army, but the Senate of Alba—Mettium. Mettius was an
old Italian name in use among both the Sabines and the Latine. It
- is doubtful, however, whether Mettius or Melius is the better orthog-

raphy, as we sometimes find one, and sometimes the other in the best
manuscripts.

17-24. Ab ipso capite orsam. “ Having begun with the very head,’'
i. e., by cutting off the king.—Expetiturum poenas. “Will exact
atonement.’' Here taken transitively. We had the same verb in an
intransitive sense at the close of the previous chapter.—-Bellum im-
pium. He calls it an impious war, as they had violated religion by
refusing to make just restitution.-Ab stativis “From his standing
camp. ” Supply castris—Ducit quam proxime potest. “He leads his

forces as near as possible.'' Gronovius would prefer, on conjecture, ,, ’

qua for quam, and the meaning then will be, “by the nearest possible
road.” But the manuscript reading is to be prefer-ied—Ea se adla-
turum. “That he will adduce such maneres—,Ad rem Romanam.
“ To the interest of Rome. ''

26—29. Tametsi vana adferebantur. “Although useless propositione
were (as he well knew) sought to be brought forward.” The imper-
fect here is employed to express the firm conviction of Tullus that
matters of no value whatever were sought to be communicated.
There is no need therefore of the very plausible conjecture of Faber,
namely, vana adferri rebatur.—-In aciem. “Into line of battle.’'——
Structi. The less usual form for instructi—Infit. “Begins.’' Sup-
ply loqui. An antiquated and poetical form, used either alone, as in
the present case, or with the infinitive supplied. Zumpt regards it as
a grammatical irregularity, fio being properly used as the passive of
facio. Madvig, on the other hand, connect-s it with favi.

29-34. Injurias et non redditas res, etc. The construction is et eqo
