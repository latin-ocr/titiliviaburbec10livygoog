“Hm-ing passed across the country by msverue hy-roads into the
Latin weyff' The line of the Via Latina was in an probability not
completed as ι regular mad until after the reduction of both the
Letins and Volscians under the Roman away. Livy, it is true, speaks ἵ
of it here aa itit already existed in the time of Coriolanum, bnt he in ³
fact uses the name only as a geographicnl description, both in this pas—
sage, and in bk. x., chap. xxxvi„ where he speaks of Interamna as a
colony “quoe via Latina estl’ Neither passuge, however, affords any
proof that the road was then in existence3 though there is no doubt
that there was already a way or line of communication.

11-12. Mugillam. The ordinary text hm, after coriolos, the words
novella hoec Romanis oppidu ademit, the exproesion not-ella oppida mean-
ing “ towns but recently conquered.” Many editore, however, think
that the name of a city ought to be given bere, and therefore read,
some Muqz'llam, others Bovillas, according to the list of conquered
cities mentioned by Dionysius, The elder Gronovius is in favor of
the latter, the younger of the former, and we have given the emenda-
tion of the younger in the text, as the more natural one. Both places
are mentioned by Dionysius (viii., 36) among those taken by Corio-
lanum—Lavinium recepit. “He took possession of Lavinium,’' i. e.,
without fighting. Not “he recovered Lavinium,'’ for the place had
not before this been subject to the Volseians. Cepit. on the contrary,
implies that there was actual fighting in the case of the other eities
mentioned. These eities lay to the east of Rome, on the bot-ders of
the AEqui, from whom they appear to have been taken by the Romans.
