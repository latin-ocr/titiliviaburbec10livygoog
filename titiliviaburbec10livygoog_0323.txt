Inter-montium, was' named “ inter daos lucos.” But his authorities do
not bem· him out. Consult the remarks of Dyer in Smith’s Dict.
Geoyr„ vol. ii.‚ p. 'UO seqq.

· 22-24. Εο, ex finitimis, etc. As the Asylum was only a small en-
closurc, the meaning of the legend must be that those who fled to
this place underwent expiation in a temple or chapel within its pre-
cinets, and were then assigned habitatione in other quarters of the
city.-Sine discrimine, etc. Zumpt thinks that the whole story of the
Asylum probably arose from the fact that Rome was looked upon as
the home of all unfortunateS, since there the peculiar regulation was
in force that slaveS, when set free by Roman masterS, became Roman
citizens by that very ach—Primum roboris. “ The first accession of
strength. ’⁹

25. Gum jam virtum, etc. “When now he was well satisfied with
his strength, he thereupon prepares to add counsel to strength.”
This is certainly better than to translate, as some do, “he prepares a
council for the regulation of that strength.'’ As regards the force of
paeniteret here, consult note on line 9 of the present chapter.

26—28. centum creat senatores, etc. The explanatione which Livy
gives for this number of the early Senate are both incorrect. The
number of senators in the ancient republics always bore a distinct
relation to the number of tribes of which the nution was composed.
Hence in the earliest times, when Rome consisted of only· one tribe,
its Senate consisted of one hundred members3 and when the Sabine
tribe or the Tities became united with the Latin tribe, or the Ramnes,
the number of senators was increased to two hundred. This number
was again augmented by one hundred when the third tribe, or the
Luceres, became incorporated with the Roman state.

Patricii. The word patricius is a derivative from pater, and patricii
therefore properly signifies those who belonged to the patres. It is a
mistake iu Livy and other ancient writers to suppose that the patricii
were only the offspring of the patres in the sense of senators, and
necessarily connected with them by blood. Patres and Patricio· were
originally convertible terms (Niebuhr, Hist. os Rome, vol. i., p. 336).
In considering who the Pati-icians were, we have to distinguish three
periods in the history of Rome. The first extends from the founda-
tion of the city down to the establish ment of the Plebeians as a second
order. During this period the patricians comprised the whole body
of Romans who enjoyed the full franchise; they were the populus Ro-
manus, and there were no other real citizens besides them. (Niebuhr,
H. R„ vol. ii.‚ p. 224, 225, note 507.) The other parts of the Roman
population, namely, clients and slareS, did not belong to the populus
Romanm, or sovereign people, and were not burghers or patricianis.
