present is here more animated than possut, as given in most editione, ¹

and brings the action at once before the view. So likewise inter-rvm-
pane.—Aditum. “Eutranee.”—Insi9nisqne inter conspecta, etc. “And
conspicuous amid the backs visible to the foe of those retiring from
the fight.” We have preferred the ablative pugna as the more nat-

ural reading. The ordinary text has puynoe oedmtt‘um, “ of those ]

yielding (or, giving way) to the fight.”- obversis conventinus, etc.

‘⁴ With his arms turned against them for close encounter.” Observe ³

that oemmt‘moe is to be construed with ad iroeundum praelium.

20-27. Lartium. An Etrurian name, and indicating‚ as Weissen-
born suggests, that there wer6 Etruriam fighting on the side of the
Romans also. —Et quod tmnultuosissimnm, etc. ‘⁶ And what was the
most furious put of the battle. ”—Prooms. The LucumoneS‚ or lead·
ers, of the Etruriam—Servitia. ‘⁶ Slaves.” Abstract for coner-ete.
—Ab'enam oppuqnatmn. ‘² To attack that of others. '³

29-35. Incipiunt. The plural, because the idea implied in alius
aliam is plural. cicere, however, in such a case, would, as Zumpt re-
marks (ξ 367 ), have employed the singular verb. Gronovius is in fa.-
vor of reading incipiat here also. — Neque ille 'trinus obstinatus, ete.
“ And he with no less resolution kept possession of the bridge in
firmest attitude of defence.” Gradus is here employed in its gladia-
torial sense, to indicate the position or ground taken by a combatant.
The expression inymti yradu does not therefore mean, as some think,
“ with vast stiide8‚” but refers to one firm and fixed position—Impera.
‘² By a rush.’'—A laer-itate perfecti operis. “ From joy at the comple-
tion of the work.”-Impetum sustinuit. “ Chccked their onset.”

37, 38. Hunc militem. “ This thy soldier. '’—Ita sic arnmtus.
“ Upon this, armed as he was.’' Observe that ita is here equivaleut
in reality to his dictis. There is no need therefore of regarding ita
sic, with Drakenborch and others, as pleonastic here. Ita is to be
construed separately.—-Incolumis ad suos tranavit. Polybius (vi.‚ 56)
relates the legend differently. According to his account, Cocles de-
fended the bridge alone, and perishcd in the river. Macaulay ob-
serves (Lays qf Ana-ient Rome, p. 43), with much probability, that it is
likely that there were two old Roman lays about the desence of the
bridge3 and that, while the story which Livy has transmitted to us
was preferred by the multitude, the other, which ascribed the whole
glory to Horatius alone, may have been the favorite of the Horatian
house. (Smith, Dict. Ant„ s. v.)

41-44. Statua in comitio posita. This statne was afterwards struck
by lightning, and the Etrurian haruspices, who had been consultcd
respecting the prodigy, envious of the glory of Rome, caused it to be
