CHAPTER nv.

1-7. Proeterea aliud. Pleonastic. —Ne rem committerent eo, etc.
“Lest they should bring the affair into such a situation where two
armies would have to be feared, at the same time,” i. e.‚ their own and
that of the enemy.—Tam ancipiti periculo aversi. “ Keeping aloof
(from an engagement) by reason of so double a danger. ‘’ Supply a
proelio committendo after avora—Diem tempusque, etc. “ (Hoping)
that length of time and circumstances‚'' etc. Compare Weissen-
born, ad loc„ “Lange der Zeit und Umstandess’ Supply sperantes
at the beginning of the clause. —Sanitatm “A healthy tone of
feeling.”

9-14. Raepropere. ‘⁴ With overhaste.”—Obeqn3tando. “ By riding
up t0.'' This compound is a farorite with our author.—-Qua . . . qua.
“As well . . . as. '’ Frequent in Livy—Remedium timoris. “As a
palliation for their· cowardice.'’--Invmtwm‚ Properly inventam ‚- but
the participle is usually accommodated in gender to the predicate.—
Et consules mayis non confidere, etc. “ And that the consuls rather
distrusted the valor than disbelieved the sincerity of the soldiers‚”
i. e., their willingness to fight. Drakenborch thinks that, inasmuch
as Fabius says afterwards, “ qu istos posse scio ,- velle ne scirem, isti
fecerunt,” the expression non confidere means, not to depend on their
fidelity, and non credere, not to trust their valor. But, as Prendeville
remarkS, it does not follow that the enemy and the consuls said or
thought the same thing. The enemy said it was cowardice‚ the con·
suls said it was want of inclination on the part of the Romana Each
had their own motive for what they said.

16-23. In novitatem generis, ete. The Etruriam, proud of the an-
tiquity of their nation, taunt the Romans with “ the newness of their
race and origin.'’-Sub. “Close t0.”—Haud oeyre. ‘⁴ without any
impatience.”— Vorsare. ‘⁶ Kept agitating.'' Literally, “ Kept turn-
ing to and fro. ”—Nolle successum non, etc. “They wished not suc-
cess either to the fathers or the consuls. '' The general negation
comes first, and is then repeated distributively with the single terms.
Hence the two negativos do not destroy one another. (Madvig,
ξ 460, Obs, 2.)-—Gertare. ‘⁴ Struggled for the mastery.’'—Eludobat.
“ Mocked them.”

25-35. Capita confirmat. “ Lay their heads together. ” So also
conferre sermones, “ To talk over together‚’'—-Sed retro revocanda, etc.
“But this wish was to be kept back and concealed.’'--Incitato eamd.
*ξ When once aroused.”— Ut in hostem animadversuros. “ That they
will inflict punishment on him as on an enemy.‘’-Quo minus consules

velle credunt. “ The less they believe the consuls to wish for battle-'⁸
