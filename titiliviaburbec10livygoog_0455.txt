CHAPTER XXXVIII.

1-6. Prope continuato aymine. “ In an almost unbroken line.'’-
Caput Ferentinum. “ The headwaters of Ferentina.’' Consult note
on bk. i.,⁴ chap. l., line 3.—Ut quisq-ue veniret. “As each would corne
up.” The subjunctive is here employed to denote an oft-repeated ac-
tion. (Zumpt, 5 569.)—Sedulo audientes, etc. “Eagerly listening to
words favorable to their resentrnent.'’—Multitudinem aliam. “The
rest of the multitude.” Where the contrasted objects together com-
pose one whole, alius may be employed with the force of reliquus.
-Subjectum viae. “ Adjacent to the road.’' Sub in composition has
often the force of “ close by,'' “ near to.’‘

7, 8. In contionis modum. “ After the manner of a public harangue.’'
——Veteres populi Romani injum'as, etc. “ Even though you may for-
get the injurios done of old by the Roman people, and the (by-gone)
disasters of the nation of the Volsci, all other things in fine, with
what feelings, pray, do you endure‚'' etc. The construction hel-eis
purposely made irregular, in order to mark strong indignation on the
part of the speaker. The conjunction ut (for the force of which here
consult Zumpt, ἓ 573) is put after the' first clause, instead of at the
beginning, so that the order of construction is, ut veteres injurias . . .
omm'a obliviscamini, etc„ and omnia, from its being a summing up, as
it were, has the force omnia denique. There is no need therefore of
the emendation and pointing of GronoviuS, who proposes to read ora-
tione exorsus veteres populi Romani injur-im, cladesqw yemis Volscorum,
i. e., ‘⁶ having, in an oration after the manner of a public harangue,
given a prefatory detail of the injur-ies,” etc„ so that the words of
Tullius commence at ut omnia. The reading and explanation which
we have given are far more natural. ‘

11-19. De vobis. “Over you.‘’—Spectaculo fuisse. “Were as a
shOW.'’—Traductos per ora hominum. He uses this form of expression
to arouse them the more, since it was properly applied to captiveS,
who were led in triumph before the eyes of the people,—Quo, si inter-
simus, etc. “ By which, if we had been present at the spectacle, we
should have profaned the games, and should ha've rendered expiation
necessary.’' Literally, ‘⁶ Should have deserved expiation.'’ Some
editors make the previous sentence end at nefas esse, and commence
a new one with quod, which they substitute for qua—Piorum. “ Of
these pious ones. ” Ironical.
