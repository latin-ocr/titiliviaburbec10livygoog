such removal of a citizen cannot be commanded. Muclx less, then,
can a tribune, who is only a magistrate for a part of the people, and
who besides has uo imperium, any right to do this—Contemptim.
“ With a contemptuous air.’'—Perturbare. “ To disconcert.''

47-60. Ad consulem. “ For the purpose of arresting him. ”—Priva-
tum. Because without any inmeritam, although just mentioned as a
rraeayistratus plebis.—Coorta. They rose simultaneously, as indicated
by con.—-Concitatoe. “ Exasperated.”—Neyotio dato. “ Having given
it in charge.'’—Saevientem. ‘⁶ Insui·iated.''—Tempus. ‘⁴ Delay.”—
In potestate. ‘⁴ Under the control,'' i. e., subJect to the authority.

 

CHAPTER LVII. ·

2-5. Patribus. The consulares mentioned in the previous chapter
are particularly meana-Dimisso tandem concilio. It is more than
probable that, before the comitia broke up, Laetorius carried through
his plebiscitum, as he had promised to do. But as it still needed the
ratification of the Senam, and of the curiae or centurieS, this circum-
stance was taken advantage of to delay its final passage. Meanwhile,
as we learn from Dion. Hal. (ix.‚ 48), the tribunes being resolved to
have their law fully established, seized upon the Capitol by a sudden
movement, and there defied all the attacks of the patriciana—Senten-
tias variassent. “ Had produced a diversity of opinionS.''—-Ab impetu,
etc. “ Their minds were called from violence to cool deliberation.''
Zumpt thinks that avocabantur here would have been more in accord-
ance with common usage. He does not perceive, however, that advo-
cabantur is purposely employed by Livy, since the principal idea is
contained in consultandum.

10-13. Tantam. ‘⁴ So great merely‚” i. e., so great and no greater.
Hence the force of the adverb tantum, “ only.’'—In medio. “ Between
the two.'' That is, there are two parties or factions, no state— Dis-
tractam laceratamque rem publicam. Commentators generally regard
this as the accusative for the nominative by enallage. It is better,
however, to view it as a peculial· instance of what is tei-med accusa-
tivus Guneus, and to translate as follows: ‘⁴ That, as to the distracted
and lacerated republic, the object songht for was rather in whose
hands it is to be, than that it would be sase.” (Consult Zumpt, §459 3
Madvig, ξ 237, c, Obs. 3.)

17, 18. Accipi. “ Are being received.”—-C'onsensu. ‘⁴ By the una-
nimity.’'—-Lex silentio perfertur. The plebiscitum had already been
passed. The reference now is to the ratification by the Senate, which
made it a Iex. By this Publilian law the plebs in the Comitia Tri-
