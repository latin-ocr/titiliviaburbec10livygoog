etc. “To the services and the banquet‚” i. e., the services at the
altar, and the sacrificial banquet that followed.--Hisque exta appone-
rentur, etc. The exta were the more important inward parts of the
victim, such as the beart, livet, lungS‚ etc. These, after having been
taken out, were first examined by the haruspices for the purposes of
divination. Then those portions of them that were intended for the
gods were strewed with barley-meal and incense, and moistened with
wine, and were burned upon the altar. .The remainder of the exta
was eaten by the priests and their attendants3 and the whole affair
concluded with a general feast on the rest of the victime-Pinarium
yenus. “ The Pinarian family. '’ Genus in the sense of qens.

60, 61. Educti. “ Car-efully instructed.’'—Donec tradito, etc. The .
Potitii and Pinarii continued to discharge the duties of their priest-
hood until the censorship of Appius Claudius (B.C. 312), who it is
said iuduced the Potitii, by the offer of 50‚000 pounds of copper, to
instruct public slaves in the person-mance of the sacred rites; whereat
the god was so angi-y that the whole gens, containing twelve families
and thirty grown-up men, perished within a year, or, according to
other accounts, within thirty days, and Appius himself became blind.
(Liv.‚ ix„ 393 Festus, p. 237, ed. Miiller3 Val. Mara, i., l, 17.)
Niebuhr remarks that if there be any truth in the tale respecting
the destruction of the Potitia genS, they may have perished in the
great plagae which raged fifteen or twenty years later, since such
legends are not scrupulous with respect to chronology. The same
writer further observes that it is probable that the worship of Her-
cules, as attended to by the Potitii and Pinarii, was a form of re-
ligion peculiar to these genteS, and had nothing to do with the religion
of the Roman state3 and that, as Appius Claudius wished to make
these sacra privata part of the sacra publica, he induced the Potitii to

instruct public slaves iu the rites, since no foreign god could have a
flamen (Hist. os Rome, vol. iii„ p. 309).
