born a citizen, the sons of Ancus would have had no reason to eom-
plain. It must also be remarked that Livy never uses the adjective
civicus for civilia—<bd ne Italt'coe quidem stirpis. Alluding to his al-
leged Greeian origin.—Tum impensius iia. etc. Observe the change
of construction, producing an anacoluthon, and convertingfilio'‚ which
precedes, into a nominative absolute.

11—20. Post centesimum sere annunt. Though one hundred and
thirty-eight years had elapsed since the death of Romulae, yet they
limit the time to one hundred, to excite greater odium against Tar-
quin.-Salva. “Still living.''—Aroere. , “’1“ο prevent. ”-Sed et in-
jun‘ae dolor, etc. Three distinct reasons are given for assassinating
Tarquinius rather than Servius Tullius, and these are severally merke
ed and distinguished by et-et—tam‚ the second only having quia.
Sauppe’s suggestion, however, of et mn gravior is exceedingly inge-
nicus and plausible—Tum. ‘⁴ And then again.”

23-32. Quibus consueti erant, etc. “ Each with the iren implements
of agriculture, to which they were accustomed.’' Observe that the
ablative cyre-stibus ferramentis has the same force as if cum were ex-
pressed with it. —A ppellarent. ‘⁴ Appealed uuto.”-— Vocati ad reyem
perytmt. “ Being summoned before the king, they proceed thither. ”
Aa reyem belongs to both vocato· and pevyunte-In vicem. “ By turns.”

himself entirely away (from the other), this other‚'’ ete. Some manu-
scripts read adverteret—Elatum seem-im in caput dejecit. “ Raised his
axe aud drove it into his head.’' Whenever one of the actions pre-
cedes the other, the perfect participle of both passive and deponent
verbs must be used, although in English we prefer connecting them

by “agdss’ and describing them as simultaneouS. (Zumpt, ξ 635,
note 1.

1-13. Moribundum. “In the agonies of death.” (Zumpt, ἕ 248.)
-Εποερίεεετιι, “ Had taken up.”—Ilhs fuyv'entes. “The men who
were endeavoring to escape.’'—Populi mirantium. Observe that populi,
here being takm collectively, is followed by mirantium, agreeing with
it in the plural. 'lhis, how exer, is a bold and rare construction.
Compare Zumpt, ς 366. —Arbitros ejecit. “She thrust out all eye-

witnesses. ”—Si destituat spes, etc. “In case hope abandon her, she
provides other safeguardsss ’-Ασοῐῑο. “Called unto her. ” From
