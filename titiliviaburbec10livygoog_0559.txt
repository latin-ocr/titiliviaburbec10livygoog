propius generally has this construction3 Livy rarely, and Cicero never
using it with the dative. With the adjective propior, however, the
dative is the more common, Cicero never using the accusative—Gon-
spectum. ‘⁴ Visible.’' cf. note on bk. ii., chap. lv., line 12.—Inten-
tum. Supply se. ⁸ ⁴

- 16-22. Propior ei. “ Nearer the enemy. ”-Ad quem capiendum si
. . . quio, etc. “And since, if an advance to take it were made open·
ly by day, the enemy,'’ ete—Contempta. ‘⁴ Contemptible.''—I)2]jecis-
senat. A common military term. ‘⁴ Dislodged.''—- Exiquum spatii.
Accusative of extent. ’ ’

30-43. Dimioatum auctores sunt. As auctor snm is equivalent to
a transitive verb, it takes the construction of a transitive verb. Livy
probably follows the history of Fabius Pictor, who depreciated the ac-
tions of Minuciae. Polybius mentions an attack on Hannibal’s camp
which was saved by the arrival of Hasdrubal and his foragerS.—Bovi-
ani. The locative. “At Bovianum.”—Unde erat The indicative
is commonly used by the historiens in relative definitions, although

they are parts of a quotation. (Madvig, ἓ 369, Obs. 2.)-Toto Sam- ’

nio. The ablativo without a preposition, aa totus is joined with it.
(Madvig, § 273, c.) This account of Numerius Decimius is to ex-
plain how he came to be in command. The allied troops were under
Roman officere when joined to the army, but came up from their
districts under their own leaders—Quinque admodum. “ About five

. thousand. '’—Vanior-ibus. Livy uses the comparative, because in his

opinion thesama victoriae was vana.

“ In protracting the war. '’—Quorum neutra provincia. “ Neither of
whose provinces. ” A better reading is quarum.

Iberian district, they had withdrawn before the CarthaginianS. ” Poenis
