Literally, ‘⁶ Were for a division‚’' i. e., to the people. Supply populo.
The verbal noun divisus occurs only in the dative. Some editions
read divisa—Lavyitioms inde proedaeqne. ‘⁴ Then ensued largesses
and plunderings.” Some editions read Iaryitionis inde proedoeqwe,
making both nouns genitives singular, and depending on dulcedine.
This, however, is less graphio—Sine ulla dimicatione. “ without any

struggle. ”

CHAPTER LV.

1-6. Gabiis receptis. “Gabii having been recovered.” Implying
that it had in the first instance revolted. Consult note on chap. liv„
line 8.—Jovis templum. This celebrated temple consisted in fact of
three partS, a nave sacred to Jupiter, and two aisles‚ the right sacred
to Minerva, and the left to* J unm—Monte Tarpeia This is only an-
other name for the Capitoline mount. Before the building of ¹ the Cap-

rior importance gave name to the whole hill3 yet a particular portion,
the most remote from the temple, retained the primitive name of
Rupes Tarpeia. The temple stood on the north-eastern summit of the
Capitoline, not 911 the south-western, as Becker maintains‘. Consult
Smith‚ Dict. Gequ vol. ii.‚ p. 761, seqq.-—Tarquinios reyes ambos, etc.
Observe the peculial· construction here. ln 'the first place, the whole
clause forms a species of apposition with monumcntwn ,- in the next
place, we have an example of what the Greek grammar-iaus call σχῆμα
nae} ὅλον καὶ μέρος, that is, the whole, Tarquinios, in place of agreeing
with the verb or verbs following, is resolved into its parts by a kind
of anacoluthon, and each part is connected with its own verb.

7-9, E't ut libera, ete. “And in order that the whole area of J ιι-
piter, and of his temple which was being built therein‚ might be free
from consecration to all other gods.'’ More literally‚ “ from all other

ever built in a place, except auqurato„ that is„ without ascertaining the
