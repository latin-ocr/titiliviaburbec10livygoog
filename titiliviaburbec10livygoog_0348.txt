344 nome.

videor audisse mem nostrum Cluilium (prae se ferre) injurias et nou
redditas res . . . uec dubito te serre eadem proe te. Tulk. “1 both
think that 1 (once) heard our king Cluilius assei-t,” etc. Literally, “1
both seem (to myself) to have (once) heard‚” ete—Neque recte an
perperam interpretor, etc. “Nor do 1 undet-take to say whether it
be right or wrong (that it should be eo); let that consideration rest
with him who has commenced the war, '’ i. e., Tullus.

36-47. Illud te monitum velim, etc. “of this, Tullus, Ι would wish
you to be warned3 how powerful the Etruriau state is about ue, and
especially about you, the nearer you are to the Tuscana, the better
you know the fact.'’ The manuscripts read Vulsci-³, but Tuscis, which
is a conjectural reading, is far superior, since the Volsci only became
formidable to the Romans at a later period. BesideS, the interchange
of Etruscus and Tuscus occurs also elsewhere. Compare book ii„
chap. vii. and ixq etc. Some read quo propiores vos, “the nearer
yourself and your people are. ”-Spectaculo sore. “ will be a specta·
cle (unto them).”—Si nos di amant. The same in effect„ as saying‚
“nisi nos dii irati devientent.”—In dubiam imperii, etc. Ἢ We are
going to play the uncertain game of empire or slavery.’' Observe
that que has here rather a disjunctive force in our idioma-Indole animi.
“From the natural bent of his mind.'’—Ratio initur. “A plan is
adopted.”-Mater··am. “ The means of its accomplishment.”

 

GHAPTER XXIV.

1-6. Diqemini fratres. “ Three brothers born at one birth. ”
Dionysius (iit, 14) says that their mothere were sistere. Every one,
remarks Niebuhr, will perceive that we have here ‘types of the two
nations regarded as sistere, and of the three tribes in each of them
(H. R.. vol. i., p. &Sy—Nobilior. “ More celebrated.”—Nominum
error. “An uncertainty as ιο the names, ”-Auccores utroque trahunt.
“Authors give both accounts,” i. e., one one, and another another.
Literally, “pull both ways. '⁷ The doubt in this ease probably arose
from the circumstance that in Rome itself, near the “sororium tiqu-
lum,” stood an altar of Janus CuriatiuS.

9-14. Ayunt. ‘⁴ Make arrangemen tS.’'—-Re9e⁸. Mettius was merely
dictator, but as Tullus was a king, Livy naturally entitles both reyes.
-Ιόἰ, unde victoria suerit. “ On that side from which victory shall
have come. ’' The ordinary phraseology would have given ubi instead
of unda—Convenit. “ Are each agreed upon. ” Observe the force of
the smgulaiz—oujusqw populi. “Of whichever people.” Quique is
here used for quicumque. So quandoque for quandocunque—Cum bona
1²⁰oe- “With sincere peace,'' i. e., without any farther dispute.
