pertinlly milred, but was nsterwsrds restored-Loca ‹fini-ra patribus,
etc. No building of course existed nt this time, but ‘⁴ spaces were
merely perted off for the senators end equites‚”where they might ench
erect for themselves plstforms from which to see the shows. These
were celled son-i, from their resemblance to the deck of a ship. This
course, with its sumunding seeffoldings, was tel-med eir-cus, either
because the speetston stood nround (drea) to see the shows, or be·-
cnnse the processioa and taces went round in a. circuit. (V arn, L. L.‚

34-39. Spectavere fiat-cis, etc. “They bcheld the gemes, fork-
shsped props supporting the platforms, which were in height each
twelve feet from the ground.”—Accits'. “Caued in,” i. e., sent for.
—Sollemnes deiude mai, etc. ‘⁴ These gemes thenceforth continued
regularly, recurring every yesr.” Sollamnie has here the force of
“ recurring at stated intervnls,” thst interval being a years-Porticus
eabemaeque. “ Arcades end shops.” In the public porticoes or ar—
cades os Rome, which were exceedingly numerous and very extensive
(ns thooe around the Forum and the Campus Martius), a variety of
business was occasionnlly tmnsected: we find that lswsnits were
conducted there, meetings of the Senate held, goods exhibited for
sale, etc.

2-17. Intervenit. “Obstructed.”-Ac prohibere. “ And stop
them. '’—Trepidatum est. “ There was a panic.”—Spatn'o. “ An in·
terval.’'—A ‹Idm-e alias constitm‘t. He wished to double the number
of the equestrian centuries‚ and to name the three new ones after
himself and two of his friends, not, es Livy says, to leave them dis-
tinguished by his own name merely. -Inauyurata “After consult-
ing the auguriesJ’ More literally, “after bringing the augur-ies to
bear upon the case.” Observe the force of in in composition, and
that inaugurato is much stronger than the simple ammata—Neque
mutari, neque novum, etc. “That neither could anything be changed
(in the existing constitution) nor anything new be established (therein)
unless the birds should have given their sanction.” In the case of
the earlier Roman kings, we find the priesthood upon the best terms
with the ruling power, being closely connected with it by the common
inter-ests of caste. But here, in the case of Tarquinius, a change of
sentiment would appear to have taken place. This is made still more
apparent by the words eludensque artem, “and ridiculing his art‚”
which immediately follow. —Aye dum, divine tu, etc. “ Come, prithee,
thou divinet, bring the auguries to bear, (and say) whether, ’⁹ etc. The

pronoun tu is meant to denote contempt. Compare the English form
of expression, “ Mr. Diviner.”
