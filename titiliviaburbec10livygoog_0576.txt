85-43. Gratia nei neuqua. “Accepting the duty of gratitudo for
the offer.” The good-will displayed by the offer thus made bound
them habos et resa-rs qratiam quite as much as if they had accept-
ed what Hiero's ambassadors offered-Tarquitum. The statue was
placed in the cells of the temple.—Volentan propitiumque„ ‘⁴ Kiud
and propitious.”-Firnmm ac stabilem . . . “ Unshaken by events, and
(what is more) unchanging in herself.” The number of the ships
has been dropped from the MSS. 3 some editum supply the omission
with centum osy-‘att ss in chap. xxxi„ line 2.—Qnae. That is, Quoe
πονοι-Ε re putam. ‘⁴ If he deemed it to the interest of the state. ”

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

2-12. Du· υωὲωιε. The subjunctive is used because design is in-
volved. “ They delayed long enough for the sllies ιο come up.”—
uilem tum. The soldiers up to this time had only taken officially
the military oath sacramentum ‚- but bad been accustomed, when en-
rolled in their cestui-ies, to take among themselves a further osth.
This latter oath was now made a public one, administered by the
tribunes—Ad ‹iecur-iatum aut σακίων-ἕαται. “ To be muster-ed into
their decuries or centur-ies.” The former word does not occur else-
where3 the latter not in this sense, but in that of “the rank of a
centurion.'’ Hence Weissenborn proposes ιο omit ad, or write ad de-
eur-ianam, etc.—Er90. “ On account of‚” “ through.” An archa-
ism preserved in laws and solemn actm—Sumenti& “ Taking from
where it is kept ;'’ petendi, ‘⁴ bringing it from where it had fallen.”

19-32. Per-facturum. “ Would finish it.” -Ven'or quam φατέον.
See Madvig, ξ soz—Quis dux. “ Any leader.”—-Jam nunc. “ Could

—Qm‚ sc. die. The ablativo of the time whem—-Quoe consilia, etc.
“ Plans which circumstances rather determined for men, than men for
circumstances.’‘-.—Dent. The present tense, as expressing a general
fact true for all time, while quoe qesta essent are the particular actions
of the consuls. So in line 30, sitis universally true, fuisse true in the
instance mentioned—Ad id beorum. “ Up to this time.” For the
genitive, see Madvig, ᾗ 285 b.—Id. “This, namely, tbat he would
prefer. ’'——Id paseveraret. The common construction with this verb
is either in with the abladve, or an infinitive3 hut almost all intran-
sitive verbs can take an accusative of the neuter pronoun denoting
the object in reference ιο which the action of the verb is done.
