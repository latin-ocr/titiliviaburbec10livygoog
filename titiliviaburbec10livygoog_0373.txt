This means generally anything for nse. It may be here rendered
“ implements.’'—At eqo recipio. ‘⁶ Well‚ then, I receive them. ''

14-18. Priscis Latinis bellumsecit. This was in fact a continuation
of the war mentioned as having been begun in chap. xxxv.—Ubi.
For in qua—Ad universoe rei dimicationem. “To an action decisive
of the main issue, ” i. e., an action involving in its issue the decision
of the whole wan—Nomen Latinum. Consult note on chap. x., line
13.-00rniculum, Ficulea vetus, etc. Au these places were situated
beyond the Anio, between Rome and the Sabine territory. of these
affatuum-tum and Nomentum alone deserve some mention. Mention
has already been made (chap. xi.) of a colony sent to the former
place by RomuluS, and yet, notwithstanding this tale of a colony, we
find it next appear-ing as an independent city in the reign of Tar-
quinius Priscae, and as having been conquered by that monarch from
the Prisci Latini. On this occasion, Dionysius tells us that it received
a fresh accession of Roman colonists3 but this did not secure its alle-
giance, and we will find it in the second book of Livy (chap. xix.)
captured for the third time in the first years of the Roman repnblic,
B.C. 499. Nomentum was the most important of all these towns, and
was situated on the Sabine frontier, about four miles from the Tiber,
and fourteen and a half from Rome, by the road which derived from
it the name of Via Nomentana. The site is now occupied by a village
which bears the name of La Meamne, a corruption of Civitas Nomen—
tana—Ad Latinos defecerant. Referring to Sabines who had revolted
to the Latin league.

ployment of parare—A liasque interjectas, etc. “ And the other valleys
lying between the hills.”—Quia ex planis locis, etc. “ Since they did
not easily carry off the waters from the flat groundS.” The subject
of evehebant is loca and convalles.— Cloacis fastiyio in Tiberim ductis.
“ By sewers led down by a slope into the Tiber.” Some read e sasti-
92⁸0, “from the high ground.'’ The most famous of these was the
Cloaca Maxima, or great drain, which ran from the valley of the Circus
Maximus and joined the Tiber below the island. The purpose of this
great work was to carry off the waters which collected in stagnant
pools in the ground t'o the west of the Palatino hill, and which was
known by the name of the Velabrum. So admirable is the workman-
ship that at the present day, though the stones are kept in their places
simply by their own weight, without mortar or cement, not one block
has been displaced in the part of it which has been explored, and a
knife-blade can hardly be inserted between the jointS. It is formed
in a semicircular vault, measuring nearly fourteen feet in diameter,
