not mean that we are to regard what he states as an historical fact,
but merely as something well grounded in popular belief. -Soevitum

The Eneti (Ἐνετοί), less correctly Heneti (Ἑνετοὶ), are mentioned as
existing in Paphlagonia in the time of Homer (IL,ii.‚ 852). They
dwelt along the coast of the Euxine. It is not improbable that it
was the resemblance of their name ιο that of the Italian Veneti
that gave rise ιο the strange story of Antenor having migrated to
Venetia after the fall of Troy, and having there founded the city of
Patavium (Virg.‚ Αἶα, ἰ., 2423 Serv. ad loc.).—Pylaemene. Pylaemenes
was slain by Menelaus (IL, v.‚ 578).—Eu9aneisque‚ etc. The Euganei

earlier period ιο have been more powerful and widely spread. The
notion of their Greek desc-ent} referred to by Pliny (iii.‚ 20, 24), was
evidently a mere etymological fancy, based upon the supposed deriva-
tion of their name from εὐγενεῖς, “the well-b01·n.’'
