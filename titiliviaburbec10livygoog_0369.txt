25-27. Ambitio. “ The ambitione feelings.²’ The word has here ’

’ its ordinary meaning, different from that of ambitiose in line 8.—-O'en-
tum in patres leqit. It needs some explanation to show how Tarquin,
being an Etrurian stranger‚ came to be chosen king of Rome. In all
likelihood he belonged to the tribe of the Luceres, which had hitherto
been held subordinate. For the Senate had been chosen only from
the Ramnes and the Tities or Sabines. There were no Luceres in the
Senate, except perhaps some few whom king Tullus had added from
the Alban families which he settled on the Caelian hill. But of late
the Luceres had been waxing in power. The Albans had been added
to· their ranke, and no doubt this addition had made them more Latin,
more like the other Romam, and less like the EtrurianS. It might
well be, therefore, that Tarquin was able by their means to raise him-
self to kingly power. This power he soon began to use for the pur-
pose of raisiug those by whom he himself had risen. Hence we find.
him choosing 100 fresh members into the senate, who were all of the
Luceriau tribe (Dionys, iii„ 67). -M ineram yentium. “ (Fathers) of
the younger houses,” The patres majorum qentiam were those whose
fathers were patricians under Romulus and Tatius—Fectio haud du·

' bia reyis. “ Undoubtedly a faction of the king’8.” Compare preced-
mg note.

29, 30. Appiolas. Appiolae must have been a place of some impor-
tance from what is said here of the spoiIS, since they furnished Tar-
quinius with the means of celebrating the Ludi Magni for the first
time, while, according to Valerius of Antium, they supplied the funds
with which he commenced the construction of the Capitol. (Val. Ant.
ap. Plin„ H.N.‚ iii„ 5, 9‚§ 70.) The site is quite uncertain, but Gell and
Nibby place it at a spot about eleven miles from Rome and a mile to
the south of the Appian Way.-Proedaque inde suffore, etc. “ And
booty having been brought back thence, greater than what had been
the fame of the war,'' i. e., greater than could have been expected
from a war of so little notoriety. Supply the ellipsis as follows: ma-
jore praeda quam tanta proeda fuisset quanta belli sama fuerat.

32, 33. Tunc primum Circo, etc. The Circus Maximus was situ-
ated in a valley between the Palatine and Aventina hius, and was
called Maximus as a distinction from the Flaminian and other similar
buildings, which it far surpassed in extent and splendor. To Tar-
quinius Priscus tradition assigned the first building of a circuS, on the
site of which the Circus Maximus was afterwards erected. If ever
there was a circus of Tarquinius, it may have been rebuilt after the
destruction of the city by the Gauls. This edifice, whatever may
have been its origin, was enlarged by Caesar, and embellished by Au-
gustus and Tiberius. In the time of Nero it was burned down (Tac.,
Arm„ xv„ 35). Trajan repaired it; and under Antoninus it becasm
