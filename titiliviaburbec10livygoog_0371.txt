mr. 1.‚ cuAP. xxxw. 367

18-24. In auqurz’o rem expertus. “ Having tried the matter by
augury.'’-—-Atqui. “lchy.‘’—-Te novacula cotem discissarum. “That
you (for instance) will be likely to cut through,’‘ etc„ i. e.‚ whether
you could cut through.—Hoec. A razor and whetstone which the king
handed to the augur. —Aves tuoe. ‘⁶ Those birds of yours.’' Ironical.
—Gapite velato. Compare note on chap. xviii„ 27. —In comitio. “In
the comitium.’' The comitium was the place where the comitia were
hela—Ad Iaevam curiae j'uit. Both statue and curia had disappeared
before Livy's time. -Sitam fuisse. “Was deposited.''

26, 27. Αυραιὶἰε certe, etc. Whatever opinion may be entertained
of the old legend, it is certain, says Livy, that the college of augum,
and the science of augury‚ exercised great influence iu the state.—

Cone—ilia populi, etc. “ Meetings of the people, assemblies of the cen-
turieS‚ the most important concerns of the state were put off,‘' etc.

By concilia populi are meant the comitia cantata. Compare Aul. Gen„ '

xv„ 27. “Is qui non universum populum, sed partem aliquam adesse
jubet, non comitia sed concilium edicere jubet.” And again the expres-
sion exercitus vocati (literally, “ armies called forth'’) refers to the Ro-
man custom of attending the Comitia centuriata. The whole people
was conceived as an army (exercitus, or, according to the more an-
cient term, classis), and was therefore divided into two parts3 the
cavalry (equites), and infantry (pedites), though it is not by any means
necessary to suppose that the people assembled in arms. (Compare
Weissenborn, ad hc.)

30, 31. Numero tantum alterum adjecit. “He added as many more
to the number,” i. e.‚ doubled the number. Alterum tantum is like
the Greek τοσοῦτον ἕτερον. Numerum is understood—Ut mille et
ducenti, etc. The three centuries which Tarquinius added were called
the RamneS, TitienseS, and Luceres Posteriores. It must be borne in
mind that although to the three hundred equites of Romulus ten
Alban turmas were added by Tullus HostiliuS, making the number of
equites 600, still the number of centur-ies was not increased, and each
century therefore contained 200 men. Hence when Tarquinius
brought in his new arrangement he doubled the 600 of Tullus Hos-
tilius, and the three centuries of Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres cou-
tained each 200 priores and 200 posteriores. The true number of the
whole therefore is 1200. Some of the best manuscripts, it is true,
give 1800, which has been adopted by most medem editors3 but this
number is opposed to Livy's previous account, and cannot be sup-
ported by the statement of Plutarch (Rom. 20), that, after the union
with the SabineS, the equites were increased to 6003 because the
original 300 are spoken of as the representatives of the three tribes3
whereaS, according to Plutarch’s account, the original 300 ought only
to represent the Ramnes,
