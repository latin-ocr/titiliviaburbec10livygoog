CHAPTER XXXV.

5-8. Cantilia reqn‘ meando. The dative of purpose or design.
(Zumpt, ξ 665. )-Fierent. The employment of this term shows that
the comitia were to be held by an interrex. These comitia were of

course the curiata, and therefore plebis, in line 9, is to be taken in ¹

the sense of populi. Compare line 23. —Snb tempus. “ Shortly
before the time (for holding them).” Obserre the force of sub in in-
dicating time. (Zumpt, ἓ 319.)—Abb39avit. “ He sent out of the
way.'’ Abhyare means to send out of the way whatever may be an

15-20. Ex quo sm· potens suerit. ‘⁴ From the time when he became
his own master. '’ Supply tempore. Some less correctly render this,
“as soon as he became‚” eto„ but ex quo is purposely employed here
to denote not only the time of migration to Rome, but also the whole
subsequent period—Sub haud poenitendo magistro. “ Under a master
not to be objected to,” i. e., under no contemptible instructor. Ob-
serve the Litotcs. Poem‘tet, though an impersonal‚ has the participles
poenitens and poenitendus. (Zumpt, ἓ 230.) As regards the peculiar-
meaning of the verb itself here, consult note on chap, viii„ line 9.-
Obsequio et observantia. “ In duty and loyalty.’'
