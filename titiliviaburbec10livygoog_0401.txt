ΒΚ. 1: cHAP. Lv1. 397

here and in chap. liii„ line 7, is a false reading—Pisoni. L. Calpur-
nius Piso Frugi, consul B.C. 133. He wrote annals which contained
the history of Rome from the earliest period to the age in which he
himself lived.-Pondo. “ Ροωιὰε.” In this sense an indeclinable
substantive; but properly an ablative singular, “ in weight.'’ Accord-
ing to Weissenborn, 40,000 pounds of silver would make 400 Attic
taleme, reckoning the mina at l} Roman pounds. What Fabius
therefore gives as the amount of the entire booty, Piso would mal«⁸
only a tenth part of the same. Compare Dionys„ iv. ‚50. -Εε nullia&
nc hor-um, etc. “And one that would be more than sufficient for lay
ing the foundatious of any buildiug, even these magnificent buildings
of the present day.”

 

CHAPTER LVI.

3-12. operis. “ Workmen.” Operae are common laborers, work-
men.-—Qm‘ cum haud parvus ct ipse, etc. “And yet though this la-
bor, not small even in itself, was added to military service, etc.—
Quam postquam traducebantur. The plural is here employed because
plebs is taken collectively’.5—-Foros in circo faciendos. “(Such as) the
erecting of platforms for scats in the circus.'' Consult note on chap.
xxxv„ lines 32, 33.—Gloacamque maximam, etc. The construction
of the cloacae is elsewhere (chap. xxxviii„ sub fin.) ascribed by Livy
to Tarquinius Priscus. Compare also Plin., H. N.‚ xxxvi„ 15, 24,
ᾗ 106. Perhaps, however, they were commenced by Priscus and
completed by Superbus—Quicquam adaequare potuit. “ Has been able
to produce anything equal.”

13-15. Ubi usus non esset. “When there was no employment for
tinans—occupari latius inperii fines. ‘⁴ That the limits of the em·-
pire should be more widely taken possession of,” i. e., that the fron·-
tiers should be more extensively secured. Observe again the peculiar
force of occupare, implying the being beforehand with another in doing
numining—Simnana. Signia was a town of Latium, situate on a lofty
hill nt the north-western angle of the Volscian mountainS.—OErcei02.
Circeii also was situated in Latium, on the promontory of Circeium.
Circe was fabled to have resided on this promontory, whence its name.
--·Proesidia urbi futura. At present they were merely intended aa

strongholds against the Volsci.

17-24. Ex columna Bynea ‘ehpsum The Latins more usually, in
the case of verbs oompounded with prepositions, do not repeat the
preposition before the case. The GreekS‚ on the other hand, generally
repeat it. Livy imitates the Greek usage, to make the expression
more forcible and poetic. —In reyiam. Some conjecture in reqia, but
we may suppose the pillar to have been in the vestibulo of the palace-
