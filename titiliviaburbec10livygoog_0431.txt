ΒΚ. 11., OHAP. xvm. 427·

Literally, “ Were sold under the crown.’' An ordinary expression
for the sale of prisoners of war, from their being crowned with a
chaplet at the time of sale. Observe that by coloni alii -are meant
the other citizens of Pometia—Dimum. And yet in chap. xxii. he
speaks of Pometia and Cora as places that then fiourished3 and in
chap. xxv. he talks of the capture and plunder of Suessa' Pometia3
in consequence of which inconsistency it has been considered prob—
able that Livy, following different writer-S, has described the same

warin two places. Dionysius makes no mention of this war with the
Aurunci.

 

CHAPTER. XVIII.-

3-8. Per ludos. “On occasion of the games.'' But per lasciviam,
‘⁸ through a wauton spirit.”—Riza. “A quarrel.”-Rebellionem.
‘⁴ A renewal of hostilities.”—Super belli Sabini rnatum. The ordinary
reading is supra, but the thirty communities (tr-iyinta populi) are the
thirty Latin cities which formed a league, and sulm, therefore, as
Zumpt remarks, is the necessary reading according to good Latin,
in the sense of “in addition to,” supra being used only of place,
“ above. ”— Octavio 'Mamilia Compare chap. xv„ towards the close.

9, 10. In hac tantarum, etc. “ While the city was iu a state of ex-
citement amid this expectation of such important eventS,” i. e., being
disquieted amid the anticipatione of such serious difficulties.—-Sed nec
quo anno, etc. “ But it is not sufficiently clear in what year3 or who
were the consuls unto whom, because they were of the Tarquiniau
party (for that, too, is handed down), little confidence was extended,”
etc. We have placed a semicolon after anne, as recommended by
Prendeville, consulibus being the dative depending on creditum sit.
Dionysius says that a dictator was appointed four years before this,
when Lartius and Cloelius were consuls, and that this appointment
was occasioned by the people’s refusing to eulist.

15-20. Consulares leym-e. “ They chose men of consular rank‚'’ i. e.‚
as Dictator and Magister Equitum. The selection of the latter of
these functionarieS, however, was commonly left to the dictator, unless
the senatus consultum specified, as was sometimes the case, and as
would seem to have happened iu the present instance, the name of the
person who was to be appointed. In later times the office of magis-
ter equitum was held usually not by a man of consular rank, but by
a vir praetorius, or one who had been praetor. The dictator himself
was always nominated by one of the consuls, but it was necessary
that a deci-ee of the Senate should be first passed, authorizing one os
the consuls to do this. As the Senate, therefore, virtually chose him
through the consul, we have quere iu the text. Some editors make
