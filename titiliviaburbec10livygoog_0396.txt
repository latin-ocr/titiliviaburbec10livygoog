CHAPTER LIII.

1-6. Dua: pravus. “A despicable lauded—Ni ‹leyeneratm in αδὺ,
etc. “ Had not hin degenerncy in other respecta matred eren this dis-
tinguished trait.” The neuter of the perfect participle passive (ὼρακ-
mtum) is here used with the force of a substantive, a practice in which
Livy often indulges. (Zumpt, § 637, note 1.)—V01ae=·ae. The Volsci
were an ancient people of Genti-ul Italy, distinct from the Latius, md
who bear a prominent part in early Roman history. We find them
in the mountains forming the western boundary of Samnium, in the
valley of the Liria, in the mountain districts of Arpinum, Sora, aud
Atina, and at one time masters of the plains extending from the Vol-
ocian Apennines to the sea, including the l’omtine marshes, and the
fertile tract that borders on them.--In dnoeratos amplius. etc. “(A
war about to last) for more than two hundred years after his own
age.” There were interruptione of coume during this long period.
The struggle only came to a full end a short time before the close of
the second Samnite War (Re. 304), when the whole of the Volscian
people had submitted to the authority of Rome, and been admitted to
the privileges of Roman citimum—Suessam Ponoett'am. consult note

7, 8. Quadrqqinta. Some editions give quadr-inmuta, so as to rec-
oncile Livy with Dionysius, who says the sum was four hundred
talents of silver, and that this too was merely the tithe of the whole
plunder! Consnlt note on chap. lv„ line 29.—Ar9enti. Some editions
have aurique after aryenu‘, but this, as Zumpt remarks, is inadmissible.

8-13. Concepit animo, etc. ‘⁶ He conceired in mind such an am-
plitude of a temple of Jupiter‚” etc„ i. e., the idea of a temple so
εραυίοιιε, etc. Some much less correctly render amplitudinem by
“magnificence.”-Ipsiu³ etiam loos. Namely‚ the Capitoline hill.
This is not very correctly said on the part of Livy, since the temple
gave all its majestas to the hi11.—-Exoepit euin. ‘⁶ Engaged his atten-
tion. ’‘-Lentius. “ More protracted.”—Gabios. Gabii was a town
in Latium, on the Lacus Gabinae, now Layo ds· Gavi, between Rome
and Praeneste. It was a colony from Alba, and in early times one
of the most powerful Latin citiee. It was in ruins in the time of '
Augustae—Urbem . . . urbem. Such repetitions as these, whether
adopted for the sake of perspicuity οι· to avoid pronounS, or arising
from hnste, Livy has more frequently than other writer3.—-Obsideuds'
quoque. That ie, of trying it by blockade too as well as by storm (vi).

15-22. Velut posito bello. “As if the war were completely laid
