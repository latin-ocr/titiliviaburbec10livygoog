xxxviii„ line 17. Colonies were established by the Romans as far
back as the annals or traditione of the city extend, and the practice
was continued during the republic and under the empire. Coloniae
were intended to keep in check a conquered people, and also to re-
press hostile incursione—Nomina darent. Roman citizens who were
willing ιο go out as members of a colony gave in their names at
Rome.

18-26. Ab Sabinis. “On the part of the Sabinesst-Bellmn5

Livy, following the old tradition, makes mention merely of the fight-
ing which took place at Rome. Other writers, however, make it to
have been a war of many years. (Dion. Ha1.‚ii., 52.)—Romanoe
arci. The whole of the Capitoline hill appears to be here meant in
the sense of the Roman citadel. In a special sense, however, the
term arx is applied ιο one of the summits of the Capitoline—Pro-
dendi exornplt ‘⁴ Of establishing a precedent.'’—Ne quid usquam etc.
“ That nothing should ever be capable of being relied on by a traitor.”
Fidum is here ιο be taken in the sense of certum or tetum. Some,
much less correctly, translate, “ that no saith should ever be kept
with a traitor.”

26-31. Additur fabuloe, ete. ‘⁴ It is added to the legend.’' Some
propose to read sabula, but this is quite unnecessary.—A ursas emillae,
etc. Niebuhr remarks that the traces of popular poetry are here so
evident that no one who has eyes can mistake them. The Roman
poet conceived that the poor Sabines were covered with gold! [An-

other account, by a certain poet SimyIuS, makes Tarpeia surrender the ι

citadel to the Gaulo, who always delighted in gold ornamentS.]—-Gem-
malosque noayna specie anulos. “And gem-set rings of great beauty.”
—Pept‘qisse quod. ‘⁴ llad bargained for what.”—Eo. ‘⁶ 'l'hat hence. ”
—De recto. “ Expressly.” A more correct form of expression than
directo, which appears in most editions.

 

CHAPTER XII.

1-10. Tamen. “ Be that as it may.” Tamen here expresses what-
eret· opinion may be formed as to the truth of the tradition respect-
ing Tarpeia, and the motives by which she was uetustae—Quod inter
Palatinum, etc. This was afterwards the Roman Forum as far as the
Velabrum.—In adversum subiere. “Chat-god up the hill (to meet
them).” With adversum supply clivum or collem. The Sabines did
not commence their descent sooner than the Romans commenced
their amente—Hostius. A better manuscript reading than Hostus.
He was the grandfather of Tullus Hostilius, and had come to Rome
from Medullia. Hence his praenomen formed from the Latin hostis,
