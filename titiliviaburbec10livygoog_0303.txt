NOTES.

 

I'NTRODUCTION TO BOOKS 1. AND Π.

Tim first two books, coming down to the year 480 B.C., give the
early mythical history of Rome. Livy seems to take as his leading
authority the poet Ennius, who as a poet might be expected to take
liberties with the traditione. Niebuhr represented the songs anciently
sung at ·feasts as the origin of all that is picturesqne and poetical in
this early history, but this view is supported by no evidence.

Seeley gives as the result of his examination the following sum-
mai-y, as a meagre outline, but one in every way probable, of the
earliest condition of Rome:

“ We see a number of‘ gentes' or clans living apparently on local
districts or ‘pagi’ side by side. 'lhey bear for the most part the
names afterwards conspicuous in Roman history as the names of the
great patrician honses.

“They are divided into three great tribeS. They regard them-
selves as connected both w ith the Latins and with the Sabines,
“Where several sacred places are near together—the Ara. Maxima
of HerculeS, the sacred place of Faunus Lupercus on the Palatino,
the temple of Quirinus on the Quirinal—a town springs up. Το thia
the clans resort for festivals, merkem, and for common deliberation.
“ The clans are an exclusive body, and are in possession of various
priesthoods and religious privileges, 'Phough we are told of a great
Sabine olan—the claudian—being admitted among them, they do
not as a rule admit strangers into their body.
hf“They have a. king, chos'en from their own body, who rules for
e.
“He summons round him a council of chiefs or elders, called
6 senatus.’ This body, whatever deference may be paid to it, has no
function beyond that of advising.
“He commands the army, presides in the Senate, and performs
certain sacrifices.
“He has the power of appointing two law· officers called‘ quaes-
t01·s.'
“There ιε a general assembly of the clans called‘ comitia curiata?
At this, among other thing-5, family questione, such as adoptions from
one clan into another, are decided.

66 The community has a religions ritual of an extremely compli-
cated yet inexpensive kind, to which it is much devoted.

“It has religione rites proper to the family and also to the gens· ,
