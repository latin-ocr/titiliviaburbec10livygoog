‚leina For the more usual hinc . . . inde, in order to show the close
proximity of the contending parties.-Pan-··cidio. The term parrid-
dium means properly the murder of a parent. It came in the oourse
of time, however, to deuote the murder of near relations, as in the
present case. Thus, the Le: Pompeia de Pan-ieidiis extended the
crime to the killing (dolo vualo) of a brother, sister, uncle, aunt, and
many other relations enumerated by Marcianus (Οἱς. 49, tit. 9, s. l).
—Partus suos, nepotum illi, etc. The progeny of the combatants
would consist of grandchildren in the case of the Sabines; of ehil-
dren in the case of the Romans. Observe that proqem‘em nepotum

is used here naturally sor nepotes, as proyeniem is the general term
to express the relationship both Sabines and Romans bore to partum

suos, whzch were nepotes to the Sabinos “illa” and liberi to the Ro-
mans, ‘⁸ i.”

9-20. Si adfinitatis inter vos, etc. When strong emotion is to be
expressed‚ the oratio obliqua sometimes changes suddenly to the recta
without 'the addition of inquit—Viduas aut orboe. widows‚ if our
Roman husbands are slain3 orphans, if our Sabine fathers fast—Ad
scedas faciendum, etc. The kings, it will be obser-ved, come forward
on either side to make the treaty‚ without consulting either Senate or
people.-Geminata mbe. That is, according to N iebuhr's vievv, the
Sabine town on the Quirinal, being added to or incorporated with the
city of Romulus on the Palatina—Quirites a Curibus appellati. Nie-
buhr, as we have before seen (notes ou ehap. ix.‚ sub fita), derives the
term Quirites from Quin-ium, the name of the Sabine city on what was
afterwards the Quirinal hill. He regards the derivation of derites
from Cures, which Livy here giveS, as a very awkward one3 and that
from quiris, “ a spea1·‚’' as clearly erroneouS. Henceforward the
united name of the two communities was not, as we might be led to

infer from the language of Livy, Quirites merely, bnt Populus Romanus ' γ

Quirites, with et to be supplied3 or Populus Romanus Quiritium ,- or
Populus Rornanus Quiritesque.—In vada. ‘⁴ Iu shoal water‚” i. e., in
a fordable part of the morass.—-Curtium lacum. This lake or morass
was drained in the time of Tarquinius Priscus, when the eloacae wer τ

constructed.

21-23. Repente. “ Following suddenly.'’— Curias. Livy says
nothing of the division into tribes, These were three in number, the
Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres. 'she Ramnes were the Latius, or imme·
diate subjects of Romulus or, in other words, the Romans3 the Tities
were the Sabine followeis of 'latius; and the Luceres were probably
Ε trux-iaus, E ach of these tiibes was subdivided into ten curiae,
making the whole number thirty. The division into curiae was of
great politicnl importnnce in the earliest times of Rome, for the curiae
