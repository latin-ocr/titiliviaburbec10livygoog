This street appears to have been on the north side of one of tho
tongues ’of the Esquiline, and to have corresponded with the modern
Via di S. Lucia in Selci. According to Varr0, Cyprius is derived from
the Sabine cypr-um, equivalent to the Latin bonum, and therefore Cypri-
us vicus will be the same as Bonus υίαιε, οι· the “Good Street‚” which
explains the change of name to Sceleratus vicus, or the “Wicked
Street.’' (vano, L. L„ iv.‚ 38.)—Dianium. “ An enclosure sacred
to Diana.'' Compare Festus= “Locus Diauae consecratus.” It con-
tained of course a temple or chapel. With the form Dianium we may
compare the Greek Ἀρτεμίσιον, Ἡρακλεῖον, etc.—Flectenti carpentum,
etc. “ To her when turning her chariot to the right towards the Ur-
bian ascent.’' chtenti, which is here equivalent in fact to flectere
jubenti, is, if the reading be correct, a poetic usage of the dative. Some
read flectente, the ablative absolute, but the absence of the pronoun is
an objection to thiS.—Esquiliar·ium. An unusual form, not oecurring
elsewhere.

28-34. Foedum inhumanumque, etc. “ A revolting and inhuman
piece of wickedness is thereupon related to have taken place.'’ Some
less correctly translate, “is handed down to us ever since. ”—A yi-
tantibus saviis, etc. “ The avenging furies of her sister and husband
urging her on. '’——Sanyuinis ac caedis paternae. ‘⁴ Of the blood and
slaughtered body of her father.’'·—-Ipsa. That is, herself as well as
her chariot.—Quihus iratis, etc. “ Through whose anger at the
wicked beginning of the reign, results similar (to that beginning)
should at no distant day ensne.'’ Observe that quibus iratis is equiva-
lent in effect to ut, iis iratis, and hence we have sequerentur in the sub-
junctive. —Prope diem. Rather an awkward expression here, since
the interval was one of twenty—five years,

36-41. Difficilis aemulatio esset. “A competition with him would
have been difficult.’'--Justa ac leyitima. ServiuS, according to the
legend, certainly usurped the regal power in the first instance, but
then this usurpation was legitimatized by the subsequent choice of
the people.—Qu⁴ia unius esset. “Because it was vested in one person
only.''—-Scelus intestinum. “ Domestic wickedneSS.”-Intervenisset.
‘⁶ Interrupted him. ’'

1-8. Ouo· Superbo coymmm, etc. ‘⁴ To whom his deeds gave the
sumame of the Proud.” Superbo the dative by attraction for Su·
perbus. (Zumpt, ἓ 421, note.) Some give Superbo here the meaning
of “ inhuman,’' but the idea involved in the term is rather that of ar-
rogance, and a proud contempt of all human and divine resti-sinte.—
