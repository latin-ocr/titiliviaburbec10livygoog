os Numa would be a tolerably correct lunar year. And this year
again he so regulated by the insertion of intercalary months, that at
the end of every nineteenth year it again coincided with the same
point in the sun's course from which it had started. Some editors
of Livy, in support of a theory, have taken the liberty of altering his
text by the insertion of the words quarto et before vicesimo, for-getting
too that the words quareo et vicesimo anno signify, not every twmty·
fharth year, which their theory requires, but every twenty-third year,
according to that peculiar view of the Romans which led them to
count both the extremes in defining the interval from one point to
another. Accordingly, it is not doing violence to wordS, but giving
the strict and necessary meaning to them, when in translating the
present passage of Livy we render vioesimo anno by every nineteentli
year. And, moreover, 19 years constitute a most convenient cycle

tgr the conju)nction of a lunar and solar year. (Key, in Smith's Dice.

which neither courts of justice nor comitia were allowed to be held,
and which were dedicated to other purposes. The dies fasti were
the days on which the praetor was allowed to administer justice in
the public courtS. On some of these, moreover, comitia could be
held, but not on all. And again, the dies intercisi were days on which
the praetor might hold his courtS, but not at all hourS, so that bome-
times one half of such a day was fastus, while the other half was ne-
fastum—Quia aliquando nihil cum populo, etc. “Because it was likely
to prove advantageous that at times no business should be transacted
with the people.”

3-12. Dialem flaminem. “The flamen of Jupiter.” Flamen was
the name for any Roman priest who was devoted to the service of
one particular god, and who received a distinguishing epithet from
the deity to whom he ministered. The most dignifled were those
attached to Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus, called respectively the flamen
Dialis, flamen Martiali& and flamen Quirinalis. The number was
eventually increased to fifteen. The name, according to Varro and
Festus, was derived from the band of white wool (filam,filamen‚flamen)
which they wore without the official apex, or cap, when the heat was
oppressiva—Sacra reqioe vicia ‘⁴ The sacred rites belonging to the
regal office.”—F'laminem ‚sot-i, etc. “ He appointed a residentiary
priest as flamen to J upite1·.’'- Viryines Vestae. Numa chose four,· two
from the Titienses, and two from the Ramnes. Two more were sub-
sequently added from the Luceres by either Tarquinius Priscus or
Servius Tullius. This number of six, according to the best authori-
