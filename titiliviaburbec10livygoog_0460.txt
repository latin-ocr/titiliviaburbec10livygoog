5-9. Adjiciebat. “ He was for adding.’'—Publicum. “ Though be-
longing to the state.'’-Poua’deri. ‘⁴ Was occupied.’' So by posses-
sores are meant “occupie1·s;” by possessio is meant the property
occupied3 by usus, the act of occupation. These tei-ms are always
employed when the use of the public lands is spoken of. It was an ἶ
essential part of the definition of possessio that it could relate only to ξ
what was not a man's own property. After every conquest, what l
portion of land should be retained as public property was determine& ³
as well as what portion should be assigned in pat-cels to individuali-³ by 3
way of remuneration for military services. The plebeians wele as
much disqnalified for occupatiore as the patricians were from receiving
magmenta—Publica sollicitudo. “ A solicitude for the public wel-
fare.” Observe here the force of sed et at the beginning of the clause. „
The anxiety of many of the fathers arose no doubt from their appre-
hensions with regard to their own property. But there was also
among them a solicitude for the public welfare, etc.

11-15. Lex agraria. This was but a revival of the Servian law3
and its object was, after setting apart the public portion, ιο divide the
remainder among the plebeians3 and at the same time, by way of
raising a fund for the payment of the army, to levy from the “ oc-
cupiers’' the tithe, the payment whereof had been discontinued. The
patriciana, of course, set their faces against such a law, because the
public land, which was wholly unprofitable to the Commons while un—
dix-idad, became wholly lost to themselves when divided.—Coeperat ,
fastidire, etc. “ [lad begun to feel disgust, that be had gone from
citizens to allies, to make the gift an indiscriminate one.” If the
reading isse be here correct, Cassius and not temnus must be regarded

as the object. Vulqatum, according to our reading, is the supine after
isse, a verb of motion.

 

18-31. Reyno viam fieri. “That the way was being paved to a
th1·one.”—Quid ita enim adsumi, etc. ‘⁶ For why was it so that the
allies and the Latin nation were admitted to participate ?”—Qm·d at·
tinuisse. ‘⁴ What purpose did it serve that. ’'——Pro Coriolano. “ In-
stead of a Coriolanus. ''—Dissuasor et intercessor. ‘⁴ The dissuadet and
opposer.'’—Aml›itiosus in socio, etc. “Anxious to be popular with
the allice, and on that account less regarded by the citizens. ’'-Sz‘culo
frumento. Compare chap. xxxiv„ line 12.-—Proesentem mercedem requi,

‘ ‘An immediate bribe for sovereign power.”— Velut abundarent onmia.
“ As if all things were in abundance (unte them). '’—Respuebanth ¹
‘⁴ Were loethed,'’ i. e.‚ were rejected with disgust. Ι

33-40. Actorem. “ The exact01·,'’ i. e.‚ the one who inflicted. The
ordinary text has auctorem ,· but auctor properly denotes “ the pro-
poser of a measure‚’' which would be inconsistent here with the Ι
