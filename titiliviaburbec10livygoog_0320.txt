out” (Zumpt, ἓ 180).-Ex loeo infesto, etc. “ He begins to drive on-
ward his herd from the unfriendly spot.” Infestus is from insero, ³
like yestus from qam—Ad dedda-ium relictarum. “ From missing
those left behind.” More literally, “from a longing after,’' etc.—
Convertit Herculem. ‘⁶ Caused Hercules to stop and turn round.’'

36-41. Fidem. “ The friendly aid.” Compare Ten, Adelph„ iii„
4, 43: “Illaec fidem nunc vostram imploras—Morte occubuit. The
accusative is much more frequent with this verb (Zumpt, ἓ 387).-
Aucton‘tate mayis quam imperto. “By weight of character more⁴
than by any actual exercise of power. ”—Venerabilis vir miracu& lit-
terarum.. “ A man held in veneration for the wonderful introduc·
tion of written characters.” Evander is said to have brought into
Italy the art of writing; but according to another legend this was
taught him by Hercules (Plut.‚ Quoest. Rom. 56).—-Garmentae. Car-
menta was originally called Nicostrate, and received the name Car-
menta from her prophetie powers. She was the mother of Evander
by Mercury. She had a temple at the foot of the Capitoline hill, and
altars near the Porta Carmentalis·

43-46. Trepidantium. “Moving in confusion and alarmst—Faci-
nus facinorisque. The repetition of a substantive under a different
form is of rare occurrence in Cicero, who prefers using the pronoun ς
but it is freqently met with in the poets and in LiYZ2—Hab²⁰‘“''² sbr-
mamque, etc. “sse person and mien of the-hem, much larger and
more majestic than the human.” Aliquantum in cases like the pres-
ent is more commonly employed in the ablative.—Roqitat. “ Eagerly
asks,’' Force of the frequentative.

49-52. Cecinit. “ Foretold.” The responses of oracles were usu-
ally in verse—opulentissima. “The most powerful.’'—Maximam
vocet, etc. ‘⁴ Shall call Maxima, and shall honor with thy own riteS.'’
The allusion is to the ara Maxima of Hercules, with which was con-
nected an ancient and celebrated temple or chapel in the Forum
Boanum—Dextra Hercuks data. Observe that the agent is here
thrown in between the substantive and the passive participle, an ar-
rangement very frequent in Livy. The object of it is to remove am-
biguity‚ and to remedy the defect in the Latin language arising from
the want of a past participle of active signification (Hunter, ad hc).
—Impletummque fizta. He means the fates which Carmenta said
ordained that he should be worshipped.—-Ara condita ac dicata. It
does not appear very clearly from the context whether the altar was
to be built and consecrated by Evander, οι· by Hercules himself. The
,latter is the more probable opinion (compare Liv.‚ ix.‚ 343 Virg.‚
AEn„ viii., 2703 Ov., Fast„ i., 581), though some authorities ascribe
the building of the altar to Evander.
