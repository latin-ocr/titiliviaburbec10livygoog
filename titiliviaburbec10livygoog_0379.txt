state, as well as of the several orders, by means of which any differ-
ence appears between the degrees of rank and fortune.’' The term .
diqnitas refers to the distinction made between the equites and those
appointed to serve on foot3 and fortuna to the classes instituted by
ServiuS, which were ranged according to fortune-Censura. “The
censuS.” This was a quinquennial registering of a man’s age, family,
profession, property, and residcnce‚ by which the amount of his taxes
was regulated. Every individual was obliged on oath to give a fair
return. —Pro habitu pecuniarum. “In proportion to the amount of

property.’'—Hunc ordinem. “ The arrangement which still subsists.'’
—Decorum “ Well suited.”

¹ 1-3. Centum milium mis, etc. “A fortune of Q

copper or more.” Supply assium, not ponde, for it must be recollectcd
that the numbers given by Livy m his account of the fortunes of the
different classes are not the ancient oneS, when the as was a pound
weight of copper, but those of the sixth century of the city. The
original numbers were probably 20,000, 15,000, 10,000, 5000, and
2000 asses respectively, which were increased fivefold when the as
was coined so much lighter (Boc-kh, Metrol. Untersuch„ c. xxix).—
AEris. Properly speaking, the Roman aes was a compound metal‚
commonly copper and tin, and therefore a kind of bronze.—Oemur2·as.
In this account of Livy we translate centuria by the term “ century‚''
but in reality a much larger division is meant. Neither had the cen-
turioe in the different classes the same number of men. Thus, for in-

class were formed into only one century.

3-7. Quadraqenas seniorum, etc. “ Forty each of the elder and the

. younger men.'’ Observe the force of the distributive. The juniores

were from seventeen to forty-five years of age3 the seniores from forty-
five to sixty. 'l‘hose above sixty years were not ranked in the centu-
ries at all, being regarded as superannuated. And as they could not
serve, neither could they vote in the Comitia Centuriata5 a. strange
provision‚ that was in forre in Cicero’s time (pro Sext. Rom, 35).
Such old men (sexayenarii) were therefore called depontam‘, because
they could not pass the gangway (pons) which led into the voting
booth (ovile).—Prima classis⁸ Sometimes they were simply called
classis, or “the class” Hence we have in later Latin the epithet
classicus, applied to writers of the first class, (Aul. Gell., vii„ 13.)—
