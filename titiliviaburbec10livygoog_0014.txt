belief in old morality, but living under a thinly disguised
despotism, and amid a general dissoluteness of mannem, Livy
sought to recall his contemporaries to better things-—as a citizen,
by recounting how the world became the property of Rome,
and Rome the property of an emper0r3 and, as a moralist, by
Setting before them examples of purity and frugality‚ of cour-
age, patience, perseverance‚ sels-denisi, sels-sacrifice. He had
neither the will nor the power to compose a pragmatio work
based on profound researches and a severe criticism, ,because
the very size of the work he contemplated set itself against
his undertaking a task which can only be satisfactorily com-
pleted when the monuments on which history is founded have
been carefully classed and thoroughly discussed by those who
have made a special study of them; and because he did not
think it necessary to interrupt his narrative of heroic and pa-
triotic actions by details respecting a constitution which was
already a shadow, soon to fade away3 perhaps, too, he was as
sceptical about the authenticity and value of the other Roman
official documents as Mommsen is respecting the Libri lintei
so often quoted by Licinius Macer, and the treaties with Car-
thago given to us by Polybius. As an excuse for the errors
of judgment Livy sometimes commits, it may be urged that,
unlike Thucydides and Polybius, unlike Fabius and Cincius
AlimentuS, he had never been in office or in command, he had
never sat in the senate, had never canvassed the people or been
elected by them, had never been at the head of a fleet or an
army3 and he, therefore, may expect pardon if, in a work not
professing to be a political or military history, he makes mis-
takes which a constitutional lawyer, a smart administrator, or a
literary general would have avoided. Remembering the death·
scene of Paulus animoe magmoe prodiyum at Cannae, let us over-
