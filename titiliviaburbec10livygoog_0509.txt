made for the SaguntineS, by the allies of both states having been ex-
cepted,'’ i. e., from the number of those against whom war might be

carried on, or who might be incorporated with the empire of either ·

tration—Additum erat. “Had there ‘been added to it.’‘--lis‚ i. e.,
sociis—Aut ob nulla, etc. “Either that no one should be received
into friendship on account of any services (rendered), or that those
who had been received under protection should not be defended.'’

(Zumpt, ἓ 709.)—Tantum ne. “Provided only that . . . not,'’ etc.
Equivalent in reality, however, to tantum caveretur ne.

22-33. Et in societatem perlicerent. The editions have ut in socie-
tatem, etc., which is so inelegant and clumsy after ut adirent that we
ha‘ve not hesitated to give the conjectural emendation et.—Bar9usi03.
The Bargusii were situated in the neighborhood of the PyreneeS, to
the north-east of the Ilergetes—Quia taedebat imperii Punici. As the
Bargusii, from what appears in chap. xxiii„ were not yet subdued by
the Carthaginiens, these words cannot, of course, apply to them, but
belong to what follows, and furnish the ground for erexerunt, as re-
gards the tribes beyond the lbe1·us.—Volc2·anos. Only mentioned
here. They were neighbors of the Bargusii.--Celebre. “ Having be-
come widespread.'’-- Quae verecundia est. ‘⁴ What sense of shame
have yon ?’' i. e., are you not ashamed ?—Cum, qui id fecerunt, etc.
“ When you, their allieS, have more cruelly betrayed the SaguntineS,
who did this, ’' etc„ i. e., who preferred your friendship to that of the
CarthaginianS.-Genseo. Equivalent here to suadeo. Supply ut with
ματαία-[πήρη “ Sti·iking.”

-wssellum Italiae inferenti. ‘⁴ Intending to bring war upon Italy.’'
Hannibal's plan is here supposed to be known to the Roman ambas-
sadors.—Tantus cum fremitu risus. “ So much laughter with (an acu>
companying) yelling,'' i. e., so much laughter and yelling.—Juventus.
So, in chup. xxxi„ the Juniores form a separate party, opposed to the
Senate and emera—oensem, ne in Italiam, etc. “ To propose (name-
.ly) that the Gauls turn the ‘war upon themselves, in order not to let
it pass through to Italy.'' Literally, “in order not to send it through,''
ete. The term censere here is too mild after postulatio, and is rightly
deemed spurious by Gronovius—Romanorum. “ On the part. of the
Romans.”-ob quoe. For ut ob ea.— Contra ea. “ That, on the con-
trary.'’——G'entis suoe homines. Especially the SenoneS. They were
driven from their territory between the Roman colonies of Ari-
minum and Sena, on the Adriatic, in consequence of an agrarian
law, passed on motion of the tribune Flaminiae, in ,225 B.C.—Et
