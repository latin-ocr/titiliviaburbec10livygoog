XVi VOCABULARY, SYNTAX, RHETORIGAL meumes·

ξ 4.—Livy makes more frequent use than his classical predecessore
of the following forms :

Ι. annnmuxvn Vanae with almost or quite the same meaning
as the simple verbs; e. g.‚ imperito (i., 2). The number of these
verbs in Livy is estimated by Miiller at 120.

ΙΙ. Vnumne in -tor. Livy first uses Interceptm·‚ asser-tor, conciter,
reductor, munitor ,- ostentator (i., 10) is found in Plautus and the Auct.
ad Herennium.

111. Vnumne in -us‚ of the fourth declension. These are espe-
cially frequent, by preference in the ablative case. A very favor-ite
word is effectu. Livian formatione are, intercursu (xxi, 46), artuatu
(xxvi.‚ 5), contactu, saltatu.

IV. Amncnvne in -alie, Livy seems to have formed matronalis,
vicinalis, cubitalis, intennurah‘o, and to have been the first writer of
prose to use junonalia, nivalis, and lethale.

V. Amncnvns in -bandue, Livy has formed cunctabundus, delibe-
rabundue, mirabundus, pereyrinabundue, temptabundus (xxi, 36).

VI. An-rne'rrvne in -οειιε are very numerous· Livy first uses oon-
troversiosuS, nivosus [Ovid], procellosus, silvosus, εει-ἔρυκε, vinosus
[Ovid and Horace}

ξ 5.—-He is t-he first to use desuetudo (i., 19) [Ovid]‚ tutamentum
(xxi, 61), cunctanter (i., 36), always with a negative except in x., 4,
diserte (xxi.‚ 19) ; and the first to use in prose yravatirn (i., 2) [Lucre-
tius] and postmodum. This latter word occurs in Terence, and is
used by Livy only in his first two bockn. Quadrifaviam (i., 43) ie
found in Verre, but the only classical ‘examples of this form are ln·-
fim‘am and multifariam. Contrary to Cicero'e use, ferme is com—
moner in Livy than fere. Haud, rai-ely found with any verb except
seio in Cicer0, is of frequent occurrence with verbs of a negative
meaning, and especially common in litoteS, as, haud {qnam (xxi,
22), haud iynotaa (xxi.‚ 1), haud incruentam (xxi, 29). So haud pa-
rum (i., 30; xxii„ 26), haud ita, etc„ for the Ciceronian non· pa·
vum, non ita. Iyitur is frequently used both in position and meaning
for itaque. Quamvis occure only once with a verb, and then the verb
is in the indicative (ii., 40). Trahere is a favorite word. Livy
never uses the archaic genitive familias. Et ipse, “likewiee‚'' ((8180,”
eo common in Livy, occure only once indisputably in Cicero,

ἕ 6.-ΡοΕτῐοΑι, Usns are, the use of bos as a feminine (i., 7); exa.
nimes (cf. AEneid, iv.‚ 672), for “ breathless with anxiety ;’' durare,
“to last '' (i., 9) 3 fatiloquam (i., 7 ς cf. AEneu'd‚viii.‚ 340); ylomeratam
(i., 31) ; infit (this word is used by no other prose writer, and by Livy
only three times—L, 23 and 28 3 iii.‚ 71); {qne-3, “lightnings ” (xxi,
58); immunita (xxii, 11), “not fortified” (in Cicero, via immunita
meane “a well-made road”); innubere (i., 34) [Ovid] ; juventa (i. ‚ 57);
