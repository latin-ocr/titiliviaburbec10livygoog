ure meaning, than to regau-d them, as some dc, in the light of present
participles, “of founding a city,‘’ “of strengthening it.” Compare
note on Preface, line '2l‚ “conditam condendamve.'’—Ab illo enim pro-
fecto. “For, undoubtedly, through the strength imparted by him.”
All the manuscripts give projecto, which is undoubtedly the true read-
ing. Some editors, however, prefer the conjectural emendation pro·
fictu. If this latter be adopted, the meaning will be, “through the
strength derived from this outset.”

27-31. Multitudine. Identical with the plebs of later days—Gele-
res. Livy is wrong in making the Celeres to have been merely a body-
guard of the king. There can be little doubt that they were not
simply the king’s body-guard, but were the same as the equites, or
hon-semen, a fact which is expressly stated by some writers, (Plin.‚
Η. Ν., xxxiii„ 2, 9, § 35.) The etymology of Celeres is variously given.
Some den-ive the term from their leader Celer, who was said tohave
slain Remus3 but most writers connected it with the Greek κέλης,
“ a courser,” in reference to the quickness of their service.

1—4. His immortalibus editis oper-ibus. ‘⁴ Tbese achievements wor-

of mortalibus is quite unnecessa1y.-.r-In campo ad Caprae paludem.
‘⁴ In the plain near the she-goat’s pool.” This plain was afterwards
the Campus Martius Compare ii.‚ 5. The precise location of the
Caprae palus is not known. It probably lay somewhere under the
Quirinal.--Cwn maqno srayore tonitribusque. “With a mighty roar
and thunderingS. ’'

8-13. Etsi satis credebat patribus. “ Although they gave sufficient
credeuce to the fatherS,‘' i. e.‚ to the assertion made by them. —Icta.
“ Struck.'’ From the verb ico, -era—Deum deo natum, etc. “They
all with one accord bid Romulus hail as a god, sprung from a god‚''
etc. The exclamation would be, Salve Deus, Deo nate! (ιω-17016113
propitius. “Willingly and propitiously.'’ A form of words usual
in prayer. The conjunction is sometimes expressed, but more com-
monly que is omitted, and we have an asyndeton.

14-17. Fuisse credo, etc. A report arising probably at a later pe-
riod, in the party strife between the patricians and plebeiaus, through
hatred towards the former.-—Il[anavit enim, etc. Dionysius, Valerius
Maximus, Plutarch, and others, give this account of the death of
Romulus3 and to this tradition Tarquinius Superbus also alludes
