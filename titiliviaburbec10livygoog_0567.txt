propius generally has this construction 3 Livy rarely, and Cicero never
using it with the dative. With the adjective propior, however, the
dative is the more common, Cicero never using the accusative—Con-
spectum. “ Visible.’' cf. note on bk. ii„ chap. lv., line 12.—Inten-
tum. Supply se. ’ ’

- 16-2‘2. Propior ei. “ Nearer the enemy.”——Ad quem capiendum si
. . . quia, etc. “And since, if an advance to take it were made open-
ly by day, the enemy,'’ ete—Contempta. “ Contemptible.'’—Dijecis-
sent. A common military term. “ Dislodged.”— Exi‘quum spatii.
Accusative of extent. ’ ’

30-43. Dimicatum auctores sunt. As auctor sum is equivalent to
a transitive verb, it takes the construction of a transitive verb. Livy
probably follows the history of Fabius Pictor, who depreciated the ac·
tions of Minucius, Polybius mentions an attack on Hannibal's camp
which was saved by the arrival of Hasdrubal and his foragerS.—Bovi-
ani. The locative. “At Bovianum.”—-Unde erat. The indicative
is commonly used by the historians in relative definitions‚ although

they are parts of a quotation. (Madvig, ἓ 369, Obs. 2.)—Toto Sam- ·

nio. 'rho ablative without a preposition, as totus is joined with it.
(Madvig, § 273, c.) This account of Numerius Decimius is to ex-
plain how he came to be in command. The allied troops were under
Roman officers when joined to the army, but came up from their
districts under their own leaders.-—-Quinque admodum. ‘⁴ About five

Α thousand. ’'—-— Vanion'bus. Livy uses the comparative, because in his

opinion the sama victor-icc was vana.

2-16. Contione. In the popular assemblies convened by the trib-
unes of the plebs—Ut vera, etc. “ Granting that,” etc. —Id em'm ne.
qai. “ Says that this is not to bo borne.’' As in the common sed
enim, an ellipsis is to be supplied; ‘⁴ he must speak, for this is not to
be borne.’'—-Ac sedulo. “ Ay, and that designedly.’'—-Ducendo bello.
“ In protracting the war. ’'—Quorum neutra provincia. “ Neither of
whose provinceS.’' A better reading is quarum.

20-28. Quo jam tamquam, etc. “ Out of which, as if from a trans-
Iberian district, they had withdrawn before the Carthaginiensi. ” Poenis
is the dative, quo the ablativo of separation—Lechaion& Ablative
of means after tutante—Tandem ut. “At length, as soon aS,’' etc.
—Ut obsidione. ‘⁴ As though freed from a blockade.’'—Si antiquus,
etc. An unreal condition in oratio obliqua. “ If the Roman people
had retained their ancient spirit, he would have brought in‚” etc.
