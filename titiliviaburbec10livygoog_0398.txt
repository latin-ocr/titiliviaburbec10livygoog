7-10. Adrebeunffln. “Toarenewingofthemf Theproper
and most frequent sense of rebelloee. Tur-quin had suspended hostili-
εἰῶ, which were now to be revived. It would seem, however, from
the expression Gabi-'s receptis, at the commenoement of the next
chapter, that the war in the first instanee had been nn actual rebelliou

emendation of Alschefski, which makes very good sense. “ Sinoe
the gods had granted to him that he alone above all the Gabini could
control all things (there).'’——Ev' dii dedissent. By employing ei here,
and not sibi, as we would naturally expect, Livy makes the clause a
part of his own narrative, and not a part of the order given to the

messenger.
